1
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,600
Oh, f*ck!

2
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:40,359
I wasn't trying to escape.

3
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:46,693
No, please. Don't.

4
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:55,813
Oh, God. I don't want to die.

5
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:03,010
Yeah. Yeah, I'll make you clean.

6
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:10,193
I'm sorry.

7
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,030
I didn't mean to...

8
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:54,638
Hey, sis.

9
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:56,837
What time is it?

10
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:58,573
Just after 8:00.

11
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,940
You want me to make coffee?

12
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:02,609
No, I gotta go. I'll call you later.

13
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:05,109
You sure there's nothing I can do?

14
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:08,749
Angie, everything's gonna be fine.
Just go back to sleep.

15
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,337
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.

16
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,710
Ben Carson.

17
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:03,979
Lorenzo Sapelli. I've been waiting for you.
Come on in.

18
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,041
Thanks.

19
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,227
How long you been working here?

20
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:17,095
All together? Fifteen years.

21
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:20,400
You were here for the fire?

22
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:22,869
Devastating.

23
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:27,341
Entire building up in flames.

24
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,951
It has been five years since the fire.

25
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:43,756
They're still in a legal battle
with the insurance companies.

26
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:47,287
Even cleaning up this mess is impossible.

27
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:50,530
I've given up faith about reopening,
and besides,

28
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:54,505
who'd ever want to shop here
after everything that's happened?

29
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:58,377
You know, the Meredith family
acquired this building

30
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:02,040
after St. Matthew's Hospital
closed in 1952.

31
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,447
It was the very first Mayflower
to open on the East Coast.

32
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:12,816
Yeah, the company wants us to patrol
the premises every couple of hours,

33
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:16,728
but I do my rounds every three.
That's more than enough.

34
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,634
Anyway, you'll see, not too much
going on. It's pretty calm around here.

35
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,601
Well, there you go.

36
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:32,076
Perfume and cosmetics department,
what's left of it anyway.

37
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:41,217
Thank God you didn't show up any later.
This place gives me the creeps at night.

38
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,850
No electricity.

39
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,523
All these mirrors.

40
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:49,834
- Best to keep your eyes away from them.
- You polish them?

41
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:53,036
- I'm sorry?
- The mirrors, they're so clean.

42
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:56,165
No, that's Gary. Gary Lewis.

43
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:58,675
Fellow who was working here before you.

44
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:01,213
He was completely obsessed
with these damn mirrors.

45
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,681
Spent the entire night cleaning them.

46
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:08,487
How long has it been
since you left the NYPD?

47
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:12,822
About a year.

48
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:17,523
I know it's none of my business,
but why did you resign from the force?

49
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:21,402
You used to be a detective,
is that correct?

50
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:23,097
Yeah.

51
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,433
I'm sorry.

52
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:27,805
I always been too curious.

53
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,401
It's all right.

54
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:41,350
There was a pretty big team
working here before the fire.

55
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:45,555
You know, when you stop to think,
of all the department stores in New York,

56
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:49,065
this one was the most beautiful,
most luxurious.

57
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:53,061
I mean, it breaks your heart, it really does.

58
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:55,601
Well, here you go.

59
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:58,970
This is where you'll be spending
most of your time.

60
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:01,877
At least you got electricity in here.

61
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:04,381
It's warm. It's nice.

62
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,883
You've even got a TV.

63
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:23,330
I opened up the trunk,
which he so called hid the pictures.

64
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:26,271
I grabbed the goody bag,
walked to the backyard,

65
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,401
opened up the barbecue grill,
I grabbed the lighter fluid,

66
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:32,208
Waiting to Exhale.

67
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:34,713
Hello?

68
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:36,942
Hello.

69
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,988
- Hey, Rosa, how are you doing?
- I'm fine. Let me help you.

70
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,421
Thanks.

71
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:43,718
Where are the kids?

72
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:46,387
Upstairs with Señor Ben.

73
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:49,693
Thanks.

74
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:53,396
So everybody at my school
thinks this boy named Eamon,

75
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,964
which is, like, one of my best friends,
which is a boy, likes me.

76
00:11:58,043 --> 00:12:02,537
And this girl named Christiana,
who liked him, is just now gossiping.

77
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:03,979
You want me to talk to Mrs. Ward?

78
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:08,748
She'll make them want to wrap me up
in toilet paper for Halloween.

79
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,618
- Hey.
- Hey.

80
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,885
Look, Mommy. Look what Daddy got me.

81
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,053
It looks great. You'll have to show me
how it works later, okay?

82
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,392
It's so fast, Mommy.

83
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:20,626
Ben? Can I talk to you?

84
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:24,629
Yeah. Okay, you two.

85
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:27,003
You need to finish your homework.
You need to get ready for your bath.

86
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:28,564
Come on. No fooling around, let's go.

87
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:30,668
Okay, let's go, Michael.

88
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:34,340
Hey. Come here.

89
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,111
Happy, happy birthday.

90
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:38,982
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

91
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:41,912
- Hey.
- Hey.

92
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,736
- What is this?
- What?

93
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:00,275
I've asked you
not to drop by without calling.

94
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:01,709
You won't answer my calls.

95
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,212
Please, Ben,
I don't want to argue with you.

96
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,681
I don't want to argue, either. If you're not
gonna answer my calls, what...

97
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,513
I haven't had a drink
for over three months,

98
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,854
but since you won't answer your calls,
how would you know?

99
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,517
I don't want to know.

100
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,625
What I want is for you
to respect my needs.

101
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,290
Amy, I'm doing everything I can
to respect your needs.

102
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,425
I haven't had a drink.

103
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,868
I got a new job to hold me over
till I'm reinstated.

104
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,464
I'm doing everything I can
to get back on my feet again.

105
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,308
What?

106
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:35,245
You don't think people can change?

107
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,842
We're not talking about people.
We're talking about you.

108
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,911
Amy, I killed a man.

109
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,684
You don't just get over that.

110
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,726
I needed time. I needed you.

111
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:47,694
- I was right here.
- Yeah.

112
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:49,229
Judging me like everybody else.

113
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:51,459
How dare you say that to me?

114
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:54,002
I was the only one at the precinct
who defended you.

115
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,335
How many times did I chase reporters
off our front lawn?

116
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:59,931
How can you say that to me?

117
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,204
I've always been in your corner!

118
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:03,178
I've been the only one
who believed in you!

119
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:05,077
You're fucking unbelievable!

120
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,116
Please, I didn't come here to fight.

121
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:10,483
Look, I'm sorry that I came over
without calling.

122
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,819
I just wanted to see them.

123
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:15,119
But we have to set up some rules.

124
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:17,127
What fucking rules?

125
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:19,755
Come on, Amy,
just tell me what rules I need to follow

126
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:22,426
so I can see my son on his birthday!

127
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:24,692
Look at yourself.

128
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:28,902
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

129
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:33,070
I don't know how you're going to be
from one moment to the next.

130
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:37,708
When I get around you, I get nervous.

131
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:40,810
Because I am so scared
that I am losing you.

132
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,648
And I screw everything up.

133
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:48,822
- I've missed you so much.
- I miss you, too.

134
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:52,598
Amy, we deserve another chance.

135
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:57,400
I know how much I love you, and I know
somewhere inside there, you love me, too.

136
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:00,068
Please.

137
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,111
Please.

138
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:19,088
I can't do this.

139
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:21,460
I can't do this, Ben.

140
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:26,596
Fuck.

141
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,406
Holy shit.

142
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:54,859
What the hell?

143
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:51,319
Fuck!

144
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:53,759
Man.

145
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:03,500
What the...

146
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,657
- You should stop taking those pills.
- Jesus!

147
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:56,556
How are you doing today?

148
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:01,731
I'm fine. I feel a lot better.
I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.

149
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:04,964
Are you sure you're all right?

150
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,236
Please, not you.

151
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,438
Okay. I'm just saying,
you can talk to me if you want.

152
00:22:09,513 --> 00:22:11,378
I'm your little sister.

153
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:14,774
It's that new job, isn't it?

154
00:22:14,853 --> 00:22:17,481
Yeah, well, I need that new job.

155
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:21,652
I can't take care of Amy and the kids
and myself on my pension.

156
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:25,026
I'm not gonna sleep on your couch
for the rest of my life.

157
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:29,762
Okay, well, maybe you get a daytime job,
a regular job.

158
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:31,599
It's not that simple.

159
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:35,504
Well, you should think about it.

160
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:50,057
Ben! What happened?

161
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:53,522
Just leave me alone.
Please, just leave me alone!

162
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:55,688
Angie, get out of here! Now!

163
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:24,686
What is happening to you, Ben?

164
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,595
Pull yourself together.

165
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:22,016
Help!

166
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:28,425
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my...

167
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:29,863
No!

168
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,269
"Gary Lewis. "

169
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,780
Esseker.

170
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,678
Esseker.

171
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,314
Hello?

172
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:22,918
Hello?

173
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,092
Where are you?

174
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,493
I want to help you,
but I need to know where you are!

175
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:31,929
Damn it!

176
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:38,602
I'm coming!

177
00:31:05,135 --> 00:31:06,466
Anybody here?

178
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:10,697
Is anybody in here?

179
00:32:02,365 --> 00:32:04,265
Fuck this place.

180
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,757
Mom! Mom! Mom!

181
00:33:27,825 --> 00:33:30,385
- Mom! Mom!
- Michael?

182
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:33,123
Are you okay? What's happening?

183
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:35,723
Michael. What's the matter, sweetie?

184
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:38,595
- There's a lady screaming.
- Where?

185
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:42,162
- There, in the mirror.
- In the mirror?

186
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,771
I don't see anybody
but you and I in the mirror.

187
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:47,142
- You just had a nightmare, sweetie.
- Okay.

188
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:49,511
Sometimes they can feel really real,
but they're not, all right?

189
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:51,675
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go back to sleep.

190
00:33:51,752 --> 00:33:54,380
Come on. In you go.

191
00:33:54,454 --> 00:33:57,252
I'm right around the corner, all right?

192
00:33:57,324 --> 00:34:00,122
- Love you.
- I love you, too, sweetie.

193
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,699
- Can you leave the door open?
- Sure, sweetheart.

194
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:08,998
- But you go back to sleep, okay?
- All right, Mom.

195
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,833
...not clear how it happened.

196
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:14,363
The 42-year-old is expected to go
on trial this month for allegedly

197
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:17,344
sexually assaulting a former co-worker
in her apartment

198
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:20,849
for 13 hours on Halloween night in 2005.

199
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:24,943
Braunstein's lawyer says his client
was mentally ill at the time.

200
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,817
The Feds say they'll seek the death
penalty against a former mob boss

201
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:31,122
accused of ordering a hit on a rival.

202
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,185
The trial of Vincent "Vinny Gorgeous"...

203
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:58,148
I swear to you,
I could feel my flesh burning.

204
00:34:58,224 --> 00:35:01,421
I couldn't breathe.
It was like my lungs were full of smoke.

205
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:05,260
It was like a nightmare, but I was awake.
I know I was awake.

206
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:09,969
- You think I'm crazy, don't you?
- I don't know what to think.

207
00:35:10,037 --> 00:35:12,062
I think you're just going through
a hard time in your life.

208
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:14,300
You're under a lot of stress.

209
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,867
You've been having those nightmares
since the shooting.

210
00:35:21,382 --> 00:35:24,715
- You know it wasn't your fault.
- They're everywhere.

211
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:29,046
- What are you talking about?
- The fucking mirrors, they are everywhere,

212
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,922
in the department store,
on the corner of every street,

213
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:33,894
in the window of every building
in this city.

214
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:35,454
I feel...

215
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:41,367
I feel like I'm not the one
looking into the mirrors

216
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,770
but they're looking back at me.

217
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,936
There's no one looking back at you
through the mirrors.

218
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:54,144
You're obviously... You're still conflicted
about what happened.

219
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:59,349
Maybe you need to talk to someone.

220
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,617
A professional, someone...

221
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:07,792
Mirrors are just glass and silver, Ben.
That's it.

222
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:09,858
There's nothing behind them.

223
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:15,071
Will you please go get some sleep, okay?

224
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:17,610
I love you.

225
00:36:32,294 --> 00:36:33,625
Coming!

226
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:38,330
Hold on!

227
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:48,471
- Mr. Carson?
- Yeah.

228
00:36:48,545 --> 00:36:50,877
You want to sign here, please?

229
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:58,453
- You have a good day, sir.
- Thanks.

230
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,232
Holy shit.

231
00:38:20,012 --> 00:38:22,003
Lorenzo, I need to talk to you.

232
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:25,983
I just had the craziest day here.
Your ex-colleagues came to pay us a visit.

233
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,111
What are you talking about?

234
00:38:27,187 --> 00:38:29,655
Well, you know Gary, the guy
who was working here before you?

235
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:30,781
Yeah.

236
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:34,020
Cops found him dead
in a subway station in Harlem.

237
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:37,655
I never liked him too much, but,
poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that.

238
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,393
Did they happen to tell you
the cause of death?

239
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:41,332
- What?
- Did they tell you how he died?

240
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,233
No, no, they wouldn't tell me.

241
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:46,205
Mrs. Sapelli is waiting for me at home.
I got to go.

242
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:48,505
By the way,
about that leak in the basement.

243
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:52,877
They're sending someone over
to work on that, beginning of next week.

244
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,744
We have a white male, 50 years of age,
name unknown.

245
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:29,054
Following the completion
of the external examination,

246
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:31,682
the body was washed and lightly dried.

247
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:35,524
A Y-incision was made
from the bilateral clavicular joints

248
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:37,723
to the xiphoid process.

249
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:40,323
- The tissue was waterlogged...
- Amy.

250
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:41,663
Yes, what is it?

251
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:45,227
There's someone in the lobby for you.
It sounds urgent.

252
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:55,044
Ben.

253
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:56,447
What's happening?
What are you doing here?

254
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,352
Thanks for seeing me.
Look, I need to ask you a favor.

255
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:02,050
- I'm in the middle of work.
- I know. Twenty minutes.

256
00:40:02,124 --> 00:40:04,319
Yesterday morning you picked up a body.

257
00:40:04,393 --> 00:40:07,453
Gary Lewis.
I just need to take a look at him.

258
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:09,228
- Who is he?
- He was a night watchman

259
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:11,597
at the Mayflower. I replaced him.

260
00:40:11,668 --> 00:40:13,135
How do you have his driver's license?

261
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:17,196
I found his wallet in the department store.
Look, I just need to know how he died.

262
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:19,977
Why do you need to know how he died?

263
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:22,808
Ben, you've been suspended. You're not
supposed to be doing any investigations.

264
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,939
Amy, please, just listen to me.
This is serious.

265
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:27,917
There are some very strange things
happening over at the Mayflower.

266
00:40:27,986 --> 00:40:30,113
I can't explain, but it's...

267
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:34,225
This guy Gary Lewis sent me a package
right before he died.

268
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:36,261
Thing is, I never met him before.

269
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:39,492
Inside the package were all these articles
on the Mayflower, on the fire.

270
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:43,195
It was like he was trying to tell me
something or warn me about something.

271
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,464
I need to figure this out. Please.

272
00:40:45,538 --> 00:40:49,201
Gary Lewis, Gary Lewis. There he is, B-16.

273
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,072
He slashed his throat.

274
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:54,478
There you go, there's your answer.
Your man committed suicide.

275
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:59,178
And you get a lot of suicide cases
with people that slash their own throats?

276
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:03,080
I didn't think so. Excuse me.

277
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:06,457
All I know is,
the police are still investigating this one.

278
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:07,826
That's why we still have the body.

279
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:10,422
What did he use to cut his throat?

280
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,331
A piece of mirror.

281
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:15,500
He probably broke the mirror into pieces

282
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:18,233
so he'd have something
to cut himself with.

283
00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:20,139
Seven years bad luck.

284
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,671
Esseker.

285
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,578
Are you okay, Ben?

286
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,614
I'm fine.

287
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:32,556
I'm sorry, excuse me.

288
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,694
I need to see his file.

289
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:39,628
- What?
- I need his file.

290
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:40,722
- Ben.
- What's the problem?

291
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:41,857
I just need to see his file.

292
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,765
Calm down. You're not even
supposed to be down here,

293
00:41:43,836 --> 00:41:46,100
and now you want to
look at somebody's file?

294
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,002
Look, I'll be off then.

295
00:41:48,074 --> 00:41:50,304
Amy, you know where to find me
if you need me.

296
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:53,005
Yeah. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it.

297
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:02,086
- I want you to leave now. I'm serious, Ben.
- Amy, I'm sorry.

298
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,254
I can't leave here until I see that file.

299
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,819
It's important, please.

300
00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:10,494
Please.

301
00:42:38,663 --> 00:42:41,826
Amy, come here and look at this picture.

302
00:42:45,503 --> 00:42:48,028
Look at the piece of mirror
that Gary Lewis is holding.

303
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:52,168
And look at it up here
in its reflected image in the other mirror.

304
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,076
It's full of blood.

305
00:42:55,147 --> 00:42:59,106
Yet in reality, it's perfectly clean.
Not a single drop, not a single drop on it.

306
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:01,620
So what? It's probably the angle
from which the photograph was taken.

307
00:43:01,688 --> 00:43:03,713
What are you trying to prove?

308
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,623
What if the mirrors are showing us
something that's not really happening?

309
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:09,355
- What are you talking about?
- No, just listen to me.

310
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:14,231
What if the mirrors are reflecting
something that's beyond our reality?

311
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:16,896
What if the mirrors can actually make us
do things that we don't want to do?

312
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,666
Like making Gary Lewis
slit his own throat.

313
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:22,575
Ben, listen to yourself.
You can't talk like that around here.

314
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:24,806
Don't you want to get reinstated?

315
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,714
Amy, I'm seeing things in the mirrors
at work, bad things,

316
00:43:28,785 --> 00:43:31,015
to the point where I can feel
what they're showing me.

317
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:34,887
Ben, you're driving me fucking crazy!
I don't have time for this.

318
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,084
What's wrong with you?

319
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,061
Do you think I'm making this up?
Do you think I'm fucking lying?

320
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:45,866
What medication are you taking
to stop drinking?

321
00:44:02,488 --> 00:44:04,353
That's a strong drug.

322
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:09,452
It has a lot of serious side effects.
How many pills are you taking a day?

323
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:15,332
I'm sorry that I bothered you.

324
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:17,536
You're right.

325
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:20,832
Thanks for trying to help.

326
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:31,142
...night at this bar.
It's a couple of blocks from here.

327
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:33,380
- All right. Where's the body?
- Calm down.

328
00:46:33,454 --> 00:46:36,116
- I can't. How am I gonna calm down?
- Let the detective by. Step over here.

329
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,091
And there's a guy been living with her
at her place. There's a guy.

330
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,721
All right. You say she works at this bar?
At night?

331
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:44,789
Yeah, she works nights. She goes nights.

332
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:47,199
She comes home late.
I don't see her come home.

333
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:48,793
She probably closes the bar, right?

334
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:52,432
Yeah. 'Cause she sleeps during the day,
like early morning hours.

335
00:46:52,508 --> 00:46:53,873
All right.

336
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:24,200
I saw blood falling from the ceiling.
Then she call me.

337
00:47:24,277 --> 00:47:27,644
I want you to ask her,
did she hear any noises, any sounds?

338
00:47:27,713 --> 00:47:28,907
- What's going on?
- One second.

339
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:31,677
It's all right, I live in apartment eight.
I used to be a cop.

340
00:47:31,752 --> 00:47:34,312
- Just tell me what's going on.
- Just a second.

341
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:37,448
I want to talk to the lead detective!
Angela!

342
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:40,550
- Who is the lead detective?
- Ben.

343
00:47:40,962 --> 00:47:43,726
Larry, what the hell are you doing here?

344
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:48,026
- Larry, just tell me what's going on.
- Ben, it's not good.

345
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:49,729
Where's Angie?

346
00:47:51,507 --> 00:47:54,601
Where the fuck is my sister?
Tell them to let go of me!

347
00:47:54,677 --> 00:47:57,077
- I can't do that, Ben!
- God damn it!

348
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:43,526
The water has obliterated
most of the marks.

349
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:46,630
No sign of struggle or forced entry.

350
00:48:47,134 --> 00:48:50,535
And the front door was locked,
which means that

351
00:48:50,604 --> 00:48:52,697
the person who did this
either had keys to the apartment

352
00:48:52,774 --> 00:48:55,004
or it was someone that she knew.

353
00:48:55,076 --> 00:48:57,772
He would've never laid a finger on her.

354
00:48:58,546 --> 00:49:02,243
You know, when their father died,
Ben took care of Angela.

355
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:05,745
She meant the world to him.

356
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:09,780
Listen, so far, his statement is pretty
consistent with the facts, you know?

357
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:12,851
We checked it out.
He showed up to work at 7:00 p. m.

358
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:14,157
And the downstairs neighbors said

359
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:17,428
they began to notice the water leakage
at around 10:00.

360
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:20,561
The only strange thing,
and this could just be a coincidence,

361
00:49:20,637 --> 00:49:24,573
is that Ben told the daytime
security guard, Lorenzo Sapelli,

362
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:27,406
that he was planning on quitting the job.

363
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:32,142
Like he was moving away someplace.
He mention anything like that to you?

364
00:49:32,217 --> 00:49:33,377
No.

365
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,053
Lately, communication hasn't been
our strong point.

366
00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:39,885
What are you gonna do with him?

367
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:41,949
I figure we'll let him go.
We got no reason to keep him here.

368
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:43,359
Larry.

369
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,871
I'm so sorry.

370
00:49:59,447 --> 00:50:00,971
Ben?

371
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:03,983
Why don't you come home
and spend some days with the kids?

372
00:50:04,052 --> 00:50:05,576
I can't.

373
00:50:06,388 --> 00:50:09,357
I don't want to put our children in danger.

374
00:50:10,392 --> 00:50:12,952
She asked me to quit, but I wouldn't.

375
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:18,131
- They came after her.
- What are you talking about?

376
00:50:21,003 --> 00:50:23,699
I've got some things I need to take care of.

377
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:26,902
- Wait, Ben. Please.
- Amy. Amy, let me go.

378
00:50:26,977 --> 00:50:28,467
I don't want you
to get in any more trouble.

379
00:50:28,545 --> 00:50:32,072
- Please stay out of it.
- I know who did this.

380
00:50:32,149 --> 00:50:35,710
Well, in that case,
you've got to tell Larry everything.

381
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:40,280
He'll never believe me.

382
00:50:41,993 --> 00:50:43,654
Neither will you.

383
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:07,844
What do you want?

384
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:09,786
Please, just tell me.

385
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,720
What do you want from me?

386
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:20,100
What do you want from me?

387
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,649
"Esseker. "

388
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:51,162
Hey. I need you to run a name for me.
Esseker.

389
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:56,104
Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo,
Kilo, Echo, Romeo.

390
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:59,666
- Did you check online?
- I've already done that.

391
00:52:59,745 --> 00:53:02,305
Nothing. IRS and DMV.

392
00:53:02,381 --> 00:53:04,246
- Where?
- Try New York.

393
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:05,944
- When?
- Last five or six years.

394
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,350
Okay, Ben.

395
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,945
Thanks.
Get back to me as soon as you can.

396
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:14,625
"Mayflower burns, 48 presumed dead. "

397
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,628
"Berry confesses to
deadly Mayflower fire. "

398
00:53:24,973 --> 00:53:26,907
"Watchman arrested. "

399
00:53:29,044 --> 00:53:32,844
"Woman, three children murdered. "
Come on, Ben, connect the dots.

400
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:35,178
"Mr. Berry maintains that
the mirrors in the store are the ones

401
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:38,414
"that brutally killed his wife
and three children. "

402
00:53:42,758 --> 00:53:45,488
"Mirrors are guilty. Mirrors are guilty. "

403
00:53:46,196 --> 00:53:48,687
- Yeah. What did you get?
- Hey.

404
00:53:48,765 --> 00:53:51,598
Look, I didn't find anything
under that name.

405
00:53:51,668 --> 00:53:54,262
Shit! Shit.

406
00:53:54,338 --> 00:53:56,898
Do you want me
to look outside New York?

407
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:59,568
No. Hold on. Hold on.

408
00:54:03,481 --> 00:54:07,042
I want you to run another name for me.
Berry, Terrence Berry.

409
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,587
Terrence Berry.

410
00:54:10,522 --> 00:54:11,750
Wait one sec.

411
00:54:15,028 --> 00:54:18,486
- I think I got him. You still there?
- Yeah.

412
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,757
- Your guy murdered his whole family.
- I already know that.

413
00:54:22,836 --> 00:54:24,235
He's dead.

414
00:54:25,773 --> 00:54:27,104
Damn it.

415
00:54:28,843 --> 00:54:31,676
Can you tell me where he was committed
before he died?

416
00:54:34,615 --> 00:54:37,914
You know, Mr. Carson, when one
starts to perceive one's own reflection

417
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:39,851
as a completely separate being,

418
00:54:39,921 --> 00:54:43,118
one is suddenly confronted
with two entirely separate egos,

419
00:54:43,191 --> 00:54:46,888
two entirely separate worlds
that can surface at any given moment.

420
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:50,262
A feeling of self-hatred,
usually triggered by a psychological shock

421
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:52,164
can split the personality in two.

422
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:55,534
Hence creating two or more personalities
with distinct memories

423
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:59,201
and distinct behavior patterns
within the same individual.

424
00:54:59,276 --> 00:55:03,679
The patient then has
the false perception of the existence

425
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:08,013
of two distinct worlds, the real world
and the world inside a mirror.

426
00:55:12,857 --> 00:55:15,519
These recordings were used
in Terrence's trial.

427
00:55:18,831 --> 00:55:20,696
You'll see they speak for themselves.

428
00:55:25,004 --> 00:55:26,938
Why did you set
the department store on fire?

429
00:55:27,007 --> 00:55:30,170
In order to destroy the mirrors.

430
00:55:32,112 --> 00:55:35,673
Only fire can destroy mirrors,
isn't that right, Doctor?

431
00:55:36,784 --> 00:55:41,278
What made you think you absolutely
had to destroy those mirrors, Terrence?

432
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:49,863
They killed my Helen
and my three children.

433
00:55:50,632 --> 00:55:52,031
For what reason?

434
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,499
Why would mirrors
want to kill your family?

435
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:56,265
- Because I didn't...
- Didn't do what?

436
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:00,437
They asked me to find Esseker.

437
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,534
Oh, my God.

438
00:56:01,611 --> 00:56:03,408
We all are looking for Esseker.

439
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,175
Amy.

440
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:07,307
Excuse me, I have to go.

441
00:56:08,652 --> 00:56:13,282
Tell me about Esseker, Terrence.
Who is Esseker?

442
00:56:13,357 --> 00:56:16,019
I don't know who Esseker is!

443
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:19,724
I don't know who Esseker is!

444
00:56:21,366 --> 00:56:22,663
I don't know.

445
00:56:30,977 --> 00:56:33,104
Mrs. Carson? It's Rosa.

446
00:56:33,779 --> 00:56:38,648
Mr. Ben is here.
He's moving all of the furniture around.

447
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:14,686
- Hey. How was school today?
- Good.

448
00:57:14,758 --> 00:57:17,022
Good. I'll be right back.

449
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,664
Dad...

450
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:33,370
Sweetheart, just give me a second.
I gotta take care of a couple of things.

451
00:57:55,903 --> 00:57:57,996
Daddy, what are you doing?

452
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:03,173
Honey, don't look scared.
Everything's fine.

453
00:58:03,244 --> 00:58:06,145
I think it looks nicer like this. Don't you?

454
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,692
Rosa, what's happening?

455
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:28,199
Take the kids downstairs, right now.
Right now.

456
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:29,832
What the hell are you doing?

457
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:32,102
Amy, you're gonna have to trust me.
This is for your own protection.

458
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:34,542
Get out of the house, right now!

459
00:58:34,646 --> 00:58:37,706
Hey, are you listening to me?
You are scaring the kids!

460
00:58:37,783 --> 00:58:39,273
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling the police,

461
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:41,319
and I warn you,
you will never see your kids again!

462
00:58:41,387 --> 00:58:43,753
Amy, I am not crazy.
These mirrors are dangerous.

463
00:58:43,822 --> 00:58:46,814
At first I thought it was just the ones
in the store, but after Angela was killed,

464
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:48,189
I realized they can get at you anywhere.

465
00:58:48,261 --> 00:58:52,197
I promise I will leave the house.
Just let me cover these damn mirrors.

466
00:58:52,265 --> 00:58:54,199
What's wrong with you?

467
00:58:55,402 --> 00:58:57,495
I know what you've been going through
hasn't been easy.

468
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:01,165
But guess what?
It hasn't been easy for us, either!

469
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:04,234
Angela was a part of our lives, too,
you know that?

470
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:07,144
It's not fair what you're doing to us, Ben!

471
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:10,980
Michael... He's acting so strange now.

472
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:15,080
He always wants to be alone. He won't
talk to me. He's having nightmares.

473
00:59:15,157 --> 00:59:18,024
Ben, your behavior is rubbing off on him!

474
00:59:18,094 --> 00:59:21,029
He is six years old. I have to protect him!

475
00:59:21,264 --> 00:59:23,494
I want to show you something.

476
00:59:26,302 --> 00:59:27,894
- Ben, let go of me!
- You don't want to believe me?

477
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:28,994
Fine, I'll show you.

478
00:59:29,073 --> 00:59:31,564
- What are you doing?
- I'll show you!

479
00:59:33,177 --> 00:59:34,667
Are you crazy?

480
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,141
- Have you gone completely mad?
- Just wait, you'll see.

481
00:59:39,217 --> 00:59:41,082
- See what?
- You'll see.

482
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,712
See what, Ben?
What am I supposed to see?

483
00:59:52,732 --> 00:59:54,495
It's not happening.

484
00:59:55,534 --> 00:59:57,331
It's not happening.

485
00:59:57,536 --> 01:00:00,334
Amy, I swear to you, at the Mayflower...

486
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,275
I am not lying.

487
01:00:21,096 --> 01:00:24,190
Ben. Let's go back inside, okay?

488
01:00:27,736 --> 01:00:29,567
Put the gun away.

489
01:00:31,674 --> 01:00:35,110
Listen to me, baby. I want to help you.

490
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:37,205
Tell the kids I'm sorry.

491
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,508
Ben!

492
01:01:10,617 --> 01:01:11,675
No!

493
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:01,059
Jesus Christ.

494
01:05:54,229 --> 01:05:56,254
Larry, it's me. I need your help again.

495
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:59,892
I'm trying to locate the patient-employee
manifest for St. Matthew's Hospital.

496
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:01,230
Where is it?

497
01:06:01,302 --> 01:06:03,497
Where was it? They closed it down.

498
01:06:03,572 --> 01:06:05,767
But it was in New York.
It's where the Mayflower used to be.

499
01:06:05,841 --> 01:06:07,934
The Mayflower? The department store?

500
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,308
Do you have any idea where
they would store records for a hospital

501
01:06:10,379 --> 01:06:12,574
that's been closed for over 50 years?

502
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:15,117
No, I don't. But I can send someone
to city hall to check it out.

503
01:06:15,185 --> 01:06:19,121
If it's a public hospital, there'd be a record
of it. Tell me exactly what you need.

504
01:06:19,189 --> 01:06:22,818
Same thing. I'm looking for a patient
or an employee with the name Esseker.

505
01:06:22,894 --> 01:06:27,490
All right, I'm on it. Give me a couple hours,
and, Ben, keep your head down.

506
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:51,414
Hey.

507
01:06:51,491 --> 01:06:53,959
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I think so.

508
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:57,788
It's Anna Esseker.

509
01:06:59,466 --> 01:07:01,730
I didn't really know what you wanted,
so I got all the medical files.

510
01:07:01,802 --> 01:07:04,862
This is perfect, Larry. This is perfect.

511
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:07,807
What happened?
Did you get in an accident?

512
01:07:07,876 --> 01:07:10,071
Anna Esseker's file,
did you have to go to city hall for it?

513
01:07:10,145 --> 01:07:11,544
No, I didn't have to go anywhere.

514
01:07:11,613 --> 01:07:14,582
All the files in that place were in storage
with the cold-case evidence.

515
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:15,810
Why, because of the fire?

516
01:07:15,885 --> 01:07:19,548
No, it's before the fire.
It's a totally different case.

517
01:07:20,223 --> 01:07:21,884
Anna was a patient at St. Matthew's.

518
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:24,586
She was in the psych ward
run by a Dr. Kane.

519
01:07:24,661 --> 01:07:27,789
Now get this,
she was only 12 years old when she died.

520
01:07:27,864 --> 01:07:28,853
What?

521
01:07:28,932 --> 01:07:32,891
When the nurses went on their rounds
first thing in the morning, October 6, 1952,

522
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:35,962
they discovered that all the patients
had left their rooms during the night,

523
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,031
and they'd all gathered in the main hall.

524
01:07:38,109 --> 01:07:40,703
Ben, they were all dead, including the girl.

525
01:07:40,778 --> 01:07:44,270
Apparently, they killed each other.
I mean, it was a slaughterhouse.

526
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:46,716
That's when they closed the place down.
Who knows what really happened?

527
01:07:46,785 --> 01:07:49,151
- What about the doctor? Kane?
- Well, they arrested him.

528
01:07:49,221 --> 01:07:51,086
They found him dead
first day of the hearing.

529
01:07:51,156 --> 01:07:54,614
He slashed his wrists
with a piece of the cell mirror.

530
01:07:55,895 --> 01:07:58,557
- Thanks for your help.
- Good luck.

531
01:08:04,805 --> 01:08:06,033
Damn it!

532
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:44,210
Jesus.

533
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:02,094
"October 6, 1952."

534
01:09:06,573 --> 01:09:10,100
"Anna Esseker is diagnosed with
severe schizophrenia,

535
01:09:10,177 --> 01:09:14,477
"leading to withdrawal from reality,
delusional and violent behavior. "

536
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,955
"Pennsylvania, August 1951."

537
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:48,151
They don't match.

538
01:09:50,388 --> 01:09:54,518
Anna Esseker was discharged
from St. Matthew's Hospital October 4.

539
01:09:54,592 --> 01:09:56,753
Two days before the massacre.

540
01:10:19,019 --> 01:10:21,249
She's alive, isn't she?

541
01:10:35,838 --> 01:10:39,205
You almost done, sweetie? Okay.

542
01:10:39,275 --> 01:10:43,712
Why is Daddy acting so scared?
It's not normal.

543
01:10:45,281 --> 01:10:48,079
He's way older than me.

544
01:10:48,652 --> 01:10:52,213
And I'm not acting scared, but he is.

545
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:58,120
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Michael? What are you doing?

546
01:10:59,197 --> 01:11:00,391
Nothing.

547
01:11:01,232 --> 01:11:04,895
- Okay, well, we gotta get going, all right?
- Okay.

548
01:11:38,006 --> 01:11:40,497
- Amy? Amy, what's wrong?
- Ben.

549
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:43,408
You have to come
to the house right now.

550
01:11:43,478 --> 01:11:45,070
I'm so scared.

551
01:11:45,146 --> 01:11:48,047
- Amy, what's wrong?
- I'm so scared.

552
01:11:48,117 --> 01:11:51,348
- Amy, just tell me what happened.
- There's something in the house.

553
01:11:52,922 --> 01:11:55,550
- Something in the mirrors.
- I'm on my way.

554
01:11:56,193 --> 01:11:57,683
God damn it!

555
01:12:04,134 --> 01:12:05,362
Come on.

556
01:12:56,091 --> 01:13:01,723
- Dad? When are you coming back home?
- Really soon, sweetheart. Come here.

557
01:13:05,034 --> 01:13:07,730
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too, sweetheart.

558
01:13:07,805 --> 01:13:09,363
I gotta go.

559
01:13:09,873 --> 01:13:11,670
I'm afraid to stay here.

560
01:13:11,742 --> 01:13:13,710
There's gonna be windows and mirrors
wherever you go.

561
01:13:13,777 --> 01:13:16,211
Anything that causes a reflection
right now is dangerous.

562
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,305
At least inside the house
we've covered everything.

563
01:13:18,383 --> 01:13:20,544
It's the safest place to be.

564
01:13:21,453 --> 01:13:22,579
Amy, I'm so sorry.

565
01:13:22,721 --> 01:13:26,179
No. It's not your fault.
I should've believed you.

566
01:13:27,927 --> 01:13:29,258
Come here.

567
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:36,225
Ben, you do whatever it takes to end this.

568
01:13:37,404 --> 01:13:39,838
- You hear me?
- I will.

569
01:13:41,842 --> 01:13:43,639
I'll be right back.

570
01:15:39,304 --> 01:15:40,862
Jesus.

571
01:15:42,908 --> 01:15:44,432
Yes, sir?

572
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:48,002
Excuse me. Is this the Esseker farm?

573
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,776
- What is it, Jimmy?
- I don't know, Ma.

574
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:55,515
- What can I do for you, sir?
- I'm looking for Anna. Anna Esseker.

575
01:15:56,222 --> 01:15:58,850
There's a man looking for...
You said Anna?

576
01:15:58,926 --> 01:16:00,553
Yes, Anna Esseker.

577
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:02,562
An Anna Esseker, Ma.

578
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:08,165
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.
I must have the wrong place.

579
01:16:09,671 --> 01:16:11,002
What is it you want with Anna Esseker?

580
01:16:18,915 --> 01:16:21,748
I'm doing a research paper
on schizophrenia.

581
01:16:21,818 --> 01:16:24,412
I became familiar with
Anna Esseker's case.

582
01:16:24,487 --> 01:16:26,819
I just wanted to ask her some questions.

583
01:16:28,257 --> 01:16:32,023
Go tell Grandpa there's a man here
who's asking about his sister.

584
01:16:32,095 --> 01:16:33,289
Okay.

585
01:16:33,931 --> 01:16:35,398
Thank you.

586
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:36,762
Grandpa?

587
01:16:38,402 --> 01:16:40,597
You know, up to this day,

588
01:16:40,672 --> 01:16:44,073
visions of Anna's fits
still haunt me at night.

589
01:16:45,543 --> 01:16:50,446
I helped my father fix up this part
of the basement especially for her.

590
01:16:52,585 --> 01:16:54,553
Her fits were too violent.

591
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:57,521
My mother couldn't
take her screams anymore.

592
01:17:05,732 --> 01:17:11,193
We had every priest, doctor, healer,
coming in from all over the county,

593
01:17:11,272 --> 01:17:13,240
but no one could help her.

594
01:17:26,788 --> 01:17:33,626
So finally, a Dr. Kane from New York
answered my parents' cries for help.

595
01:17:35,832 --> 01:17:39,768
He rejected the idea of demonic
possession, said he didn't believe in it.

596
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:44,467
He was convinced Anna suffered from
a rare form of personality disorder

597
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:48,009
and mirrors could help her.

598
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:52,405
He wanted Anna under his care,
at St. Matthew's.

599
01:17:53,451 --> 01:17:55,578
My parents were very poor,

600
01:17:55,654 --> 01:17:59,055
but he agreed to cover all the costs
of the hospital.

601
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:01,684
Where did she go after the hospital?

602
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:03,160
Don't you know?

603
01:18:03,229 --> 01:18:05,857
She died there
with all of Kane's other patients.

604
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:08,366
Mr. Esseker, I read the file.

605
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:11,164
Anna left the hospital
two days before the massacre.

606
01:18:11,238 --> 01:18:14,730
Dr. Kane altered the documents
so she could disappear.

607
01:18:16,877 --> 01:18:18,401
Where did you get that document?

608
01:18:18,478 --> 01:18:21,936
I need you to tell me where she went
after St. Matthew's.

609
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,016
She came back
and stayed with us for a while.

610
01:18:25,086 --> 01:18:29,352
What do you mean for a while?
What happened? Why did she leave?

611
01:18:29,424 --> 01:18:32,188
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Why did she leave?

612
01:18:33,696 --> 01:18:36,426
Because strange things
started to happen in the house.

613
01:18:36,498 --> 01:18:37,522
With Anna?

614
01:18:37,599 --> 01:18:41,057
No, no, not with Anna anymore.
No, she was totally cured.

615
01:18:43,106 --> 01:18:46,633
Strange things started to happen
with the mirrors, didn't they?

616
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:50,009
Mr. Esseker, I need to know where Anna
is now. It's a matter of life and death.

617
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,412
Do not make me threaten you.

618
01:18:52,483 --> 01:18:57,477
We sent her somewhere
where mirrors are forbidden.

619
01:18:58,556 --> 01:19:02,424
- Where the mirrors couldn't find her.
- Where? Where?

620
01:19:03,595 --> 01:19:06,962
St. Augustine's Monastery,
on the road to Reedfield.

621
01:20:09,567 --> 01:20:11,262
How can I help you?

622
01:20:12,704 --> 01:20:14,228
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sister,

623
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:18,572
but I've come to speak with a member
of your community. Anna Esseker.

624
01:20:18,977 --> 01:20:21,036
Is she expecting you?

625
01:20:21,313 --> 01:20:22,610
No, not really.

626
01:20:22,682 --> 01:20:25,549
If you're not listed, I cannot help you, sir.

627
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:29,714
Can you at least tell her
that I've come from New York

628
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:31,814
to speak with her?

629
01:20:31,892 --> 01:20:35,157
I work with Dr. Kane
from St. Matthew's Hospital.

630
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:38,225
It's very important, please.

631
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:48,371
St. Matthew's closed down in 1952.
Who are you?

632
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,604
My name is Benjamin Carson.

633
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:54,846
I work as a night watchman
on Sixth Avenue in New York City

634
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:58,216
in the building that used to be
St. Matthew's Hospital.

635
01:20:58,287 --> 01:21:00,847
What is it you want, Mr. Carson?

636
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:03,122
My family is in danger,

637
01:21:03,193 --> 01:21:05,821
and what's threatening them
is asking for you.

638
01:21:05,896 --> 01:21:10,094
I came all this way to ask you

639
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:12,397
why the mirrors that were left over
from St. Matthew's Hospital

640
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:14,734
are so desperate to find you.

641
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,769
Please, Miss Esseker.

642
01:21:18,409 --> 01:21:20,172
If you don't help me,

643
01:21:20,245 --> 01:21:22,577
I'm gonna lose the most important thing
to me in this world,

644
01:21:22,648 --> 01:21:24,343
and that's my family.

645
01:21:27,987 --> 01:21:29,921
Sit down, Mr. Carson.

646
01:21:38,999 --> 01:21:41,968
The mirrors are merely windows
on our world.

647
01:21:43,237 --> 01:21:46,104
It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me

648
01:21:47,175 --> 01:21:50,110
but of what is imprisoned inside them.

649
01:21:50,178 --> 01:21:52,271
What is imprisoned inside them?

650
01:21:53,649 --> 01:21:57,176
At the time that I was at St. Matthew's,

651
01:21:58,187 --> 01:22:01,782
Dr. Kane's therapy
for personality disorders

652
01:22:01,857 --> 01:22:06,726
consisted of locking the patient up
in a mirrored room

653
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:12,962
for several days on end,
forcing them to confront their own image.

654
01:22:15,206 --> 01:22:18,437
Dr. Kane was wrong about his theory.

655
01:22:18,943 --> 01:22:22,640
There is no cure for schizophrenia,
Mr. Carson.

656
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:28,184
It was something else.

657
01:22:28,853 --> 01:22:34,917
And whatever it was,
it left me and entered the mirrors.

658
01:22:36,796 --> 01:22:38,195
Since that day,

659
01:22:38,264 --> 01:22:41,859
it has been collecting
the souls of the people it kills.

660
01:22:42,902 --> 01:22:45,063
I'm sorry,

661
01:22:45,138 --> 01:22:48,471
but if I agree to go with you
and return back to that place,

662
01:22:48,542 --> 01:22:50,271
I will make it possible for the demon

663
01:22:50,344 --> 01:22:53,211
to cross the threshold
back into the real world.

664
01:22:53,314 --> 01:22:55,839
Do you understand
what that means for my family?

665
01:22:55,917 --> 01:22:59,045
You can't do this.
You need to come back with me.

666
01:22:59,887 --> 01:23:02,856
I'm going to pray for you and your family.

667
01:23:02,924 --> 01:23:06,485
That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson.
I'm sorry.

668
01:23:08,063 --> 01:23:09,758
God bless you.

669
01:23:10,966 --> 01:23:16,199
Gary Lewis, Terrence Berry and many
other men have died trying to find you.

670
01:23:16,273 --> 01:23:18,468
And because they failed,
their families died, too.

671
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:21,169
Two days ago my sister was murdered.

672
01:23:21,811 --> 01:23:24,837
My family will be next
if you don't help me.

673
01:23:25,283 --> 01:23:26,648
Please.

674
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:29,948
Please. Wait, wait.

675
01:23:33,558 --> 01:23:34,991
This is my family.

676
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:36,960
This is my wife Amy

677
01:23:37,029 --> 01:23:39,793
and my daughter Daisy
and my son Michael.

678
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:42,294
They're beautiful.

679
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:45,794
They're innocent.
They've never hurt anybody.

680
01:23:47,907 --> 01:23:49,340
Please.

681
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:51,166
Take the photo.

682
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:54,408
Just take the photo.

683
01:24:03,457 --> 01:24:04,947
Look at them.

684
01:24:07,962 --> 01:24:09,429
I'm sorry.

685
01:24:11,933 --> 01:24:14,401
Who the hell do you think you are?

686
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,467
They're just kids!

687
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:55,980
- Hello?
- Amy.

688
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,643
- Ben, where are you?
- At the monastery.

689
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:00,950
- Did you find her?
- Yes.

690
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:03,045
Yeah? Did you talk to...

691
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,817
- Amy?
- Michael?

692
01:25:07,495 --> 01:25:08,894
Michael?

693
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:11,291
Ben, hold on, Michael's gone.

694
01:25:11,365 --> 01:25:12,627
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

695
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,100
I fell asleep with the kids on the bed
and now I don't know where he is.

696
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:16,228
Michael?

697
01:25:16,304 --> 01:25:17,703
Amy, what's going on?
Is everything all right?

698
01:25:19,174 --> 01:25:20,232
Oh, fuck.

699
01:25:20,976 --> 01:25:22,534
Amy, what's going on?
Have you got Michael?

700
01:25:23,979 --> 01:25:25,207
Oh, my God.

701
01:25:26,082 --> 01:25:28,710
Ben, there's water everywhere.

702
01:25:29,752 --> 01:25:30,741
Oh, my God.

703
01:25:30,853 --> 01:25:34,550
You've got to be careful of the water.
It creates reflections.

704
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:37,589
Someone is in the house.

705
01:25:37,661 --> 01:25:39,356
Someone scraped all the mirrors!

706
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:41,022
Amy, where is Michael?

707
01:25:41,098 --> 01:25:43,760
I don't know. I don't know where he is.
I don't see him anywhere.

708
01:25:43,834 --> 01:25:45,665
Amy, listen to me,
you've gotta stay away from the water.

709
01:25:45,737 --> 01:25:48,467
Get the kids
and stay away from the water!

710
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:51,033
- Michael?
- Amy?

711
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:53,407
Amy? Shit!

712
01:26:02,121 --> 01:26:04,988
Which room is she in? Which one?

713
01:26:09,229 --> 01:26:11,925
My family is not dying tonight.
You are coming with me.

714
01:26:26,782 --> 01:26:27,976
Michael?

715
01:26:46,704 --> 01:26:47,932
Daisy?

716
01:26:51,008 --> 01:26:52,669
Daisy, come here.

717
01:27:06,692 --> 01:27:08,250
Come here, Daisy.

718
01:27:09,595 --> 01:27:10,653
Mom?

719
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:18,637
Come here, sweetheart.

720
01:27:38,327 --> 01:27:40,227
What are you doing in there?

721
01:27:42,164 --> 01:27:44,496
Everything's going to be all right.

722
01:27:58,716 --> 01:28:00,274
No!

723
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:06,088
No! No!

724
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:07,317
Daisy!

725
01:28:10,395 --> 01:28:12,454
Come here! Get down!
Get down, right now!

726
01:28:12,531 --> 01:28:15,466
Get down, sweetie. Get down.
Oh, my God, are you okay?

727
01:28:15,534 --> 01:28:19,026
Oh, my God! Stay right there.
Don't move, baby! Don't move!

728
01:28:19,105 --> 01:28:21,539
- Mom, why did you do that to me?
- It wasn't me, sweetheart.

729
01:28:21,608 --> 01:28:23,542
You know I would never hurt you.
You know that.

730
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:25,942
Here. Hold this. Hold it tight.

731
01:28:27,381 --> 01:28:28,405
Okay?

732
01:28:31,285 --> 01:28:34,652
Here, get down, sweetie.
Let me see. Let me see.

733
01:28:36,557 --> 01:28:38,787
Let me see, sweetie. It's gonna be okay.

734
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:41,920
All right? I know it hurts. Stay right there.

735
01:28:43,999 --> 01:28:47,435
All right. Give me your hand.
I need you to hold it really tight, okay?

736
01:28:47,503 --> 01:28:50,028
Just flat and tight, just like that. Okay.

737
01:28:50,106 --> 01:28:53,405
Now, I need you to listen to me,
okay, baby?

738
01:28:53,476 --> 01:28:55,376
- You have to be very brave.
- Okay.

739
01:28:55,444 --> 01:28:57,241
I need you to stay here
no matter what happens.

740
01:28:57,314 --> 01:29:00,875
No matter what you hear. Do not move
from this closet until I come back.

741
01:29:00,951 --> 01:29:02,418
- You understand me, right?
- Yes.

742
01:29:02,486 --> 01:29:05,284
Okay. Okay.

743
01:29:05,355 --> 01:29:07,482
Do not move. I love you.

744
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:10,052
Don't move.

745
01:29:37,825 --> 01:29:39,156
Michael?

746
01:29:56,912 --> 01:29:58,209
Michael?

747
01:30:01,384 --> 01:30:02,715
Where are you?

748
01:30:05,154 --> 01:30:06,416
Michael?

749
01:30:24,342 --> 01:30:25,604
Michael!

750
01:30:26,244 --> 01:30:28,405
Michael, what are you doing?

751
01:30:32,585 --> 01:30:36,749
Don't be scared, Mommy.
He just wants to play with us.

752
01:30:37,156 --> 01:30:40,489
Michael, I want you to drop that knife,
right now.

753
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,084
Do you hear me?

754
01:30:43,163 --> 01:30:47,395
You know very well you're not allowed
to play with knives. Don't you?

755
01:30:49,504 --> 01:30:50,698
Come on.

756
01:30:54,308 --> 01:30:56,037
That's a good boy.

757
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:58,503
Give me the knife, Michael.

758
01:30:59,114 --> 01:31:01,082
Michael! Michael!

759
01:31:04,153 --> 01:31:05,552
Michael?

760
01:31:13,596 --> 01:31:14,858
Michael!

761
01:31:16,032 --> 01:31:17,363
Michael!

762
01:31:21,071 --> 01:31:22,504
Michael?

763
01:31:24,108 --> 01:31:25,632
Michael.

764
01:31:27,011 --> 01:31:28,342
Michael?

765
01:31:29,147 --> 01:31:31,843
Why are you hiding from me, sweetheart?

766
01:31:43,496 --> 01:31:44,986
Michael?

767
01:32:37,421 --> 01:32:40,356
You okay? Come on.

768
01:33:27,376 --> 01:33:29,844
It's waiting for me downstairs.

769
01:33:39,156 --> 01:33:43,422
Bring me inside. From now on,
I have to keep my eyes closed.

770
01:33:44,228 --> 01:33:47,026
Step up. You're in the room.

771
01:33:47,565 --> 01:33:49,260
Strap me in.

772
01:33:58,243 --> 01:34:00,973
I spent the darkest days of my life
in this room.

773
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:05,540
Are you sure there's no other way?

774
01:34:05,618 --> 01:34:08,212
This is for your family, Mr. Carson.

775
01:34:09,589 --> 01:34:11,250
For your family.

776
01:34:25,374 --> 01:34:26,739
Michael?

777
01:35:10,956 --> 01:35:13,220
Michael? Michael, look at me.

778
01:35:15,762 --> 01:35:18,526
Michael! No, Michael!

779
01:35:19,032 --> 01:35:22,991
No! Give him back to me! Give him back!

780
01:35:24,772 --> 01:35:26,296
No!

781
01:35:27,809 --> 01:35:30,039
No! Get out!

782
01:35:30,111 --> 01:35:32,079
Come on, Michael!

783
01:35:32,147 --> 01:35:33,512
No!

784
01:35:33,582 --> 01:35:35,243
Please. Please.

785
01:35:37,686 --> 01:35:39,051
You must go now.

786
01:35:39,121 --> 01:35:40,554
Thank you.

787
01:35:41,491 --> 01:35:42,788
No!

788
01:35:46,996 --> 01:35:48,327
Why?

789
01:36:23,971 --> 01:36:26,030
Give him back, please!

790
01:36:26,106 --> 01:36:29,041
Give him back! Give him back!

791
01:36:29,943 --> 01:36:31,137
Michael!

792
01:36:33,047 --> 01:36:36,483
No! No!

793
01:37:00,911 --> 01:37:01,900
Michael?

794
01:37:01,978 --> 01:37:03,809
Oh, my baby!

795
01:37:29,442 --> 01:37:30,807
Come on.

796
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:35,477
One, two, three...

797
01:37:42,958 --> 01:37:44,585
...five, six...

798
01:37:47,729 --> 01:37:49,162
Thank God!

799
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:57,571
Thank you. I love you!

800
01:38:09,653 --> 01:38:10,745
Anna?

801
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:40,583
Anna?

802
01:40:22,665 --> 01:40:24,565
Come out, you bitch!

803
01:42:36,313 --> 01:42:37,974
Oh, my God.

804
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:41,679
Oh, my baby.

805
01:42:46,157 --> 01:42:47,784
I love you both.

806
01:42:55,935 --> 01:42:57,562
I love you, guys.
