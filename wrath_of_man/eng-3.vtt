WEBVTT

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.292
<i>Copy that! Over and out.</i>

00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:50.167
Gotta get these hinges greased, Mick. Come on.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.083
The grease isn't the problem.

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:53.667
It's the hinge.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.917
This is a creaky old dinosaur.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.667
This old girl should've
been retired ten years ago.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.583
Yeah. Well, they should've
retired me ten years ago.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:05.375
Not you, Charlie. You're in your prime.

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:07.792
I should know because we're the same age

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:09.000
and I'm in my prime.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.625
Hey, is that coffee still hot?

00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:14.958
Yeah, it's hot enough.

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:15.958
All right, then.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.167
Do me a favor.

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:23.542
You ever thought about
buying a coffee maker?

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:24.750
Coffee maker?

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:28.208
You know, one that's
got that milk froster thing.

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:31.125
- Oh, yeah. Frother. I got you.
- Yeah.

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:33.333
- That way you can...
- Thanks.

00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:35.500
...you know, make your own cappuccino.

00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:37.083
Oh, goddamn.

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:39.417
I thought you said this coffee was hot.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.875
What is this?

00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.250
Dude, it's typical. What's our time?

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.750
I don't know,
but this truck needs to get moving.

00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:48.458
The game's gonna be starting soon.

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.583
The freeway's gonna be backed up.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:52.375
- Oh, fuck! Shit!
- Reverse!

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:55.708
- The fuck are we supposed to do now?
- You know what to do, follow protocol.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.500
What the fuck!

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:01.042
- Dispatch, come in!
- They're cutting the fucking door!

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:04.750
We're being hit by armed assailants.
Repeat, armed robbery in progress.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:05.875
Coming in!

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.708
They're cutting the door.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:24.167
Hands up! Hands up in the air.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.500
Let's go, move it.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:30.833
Get the fuck out.
Keep your hands away from your weapons.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.750
Hands away from your weapons.

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:35.667
Come on, let's go.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.000
<i>- Fortico 1377, alarm raised...
- Move!</i>

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:40.083
Fuck me.

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:43.083
<i>- Alarm registered.
- Clear!</i>

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:45.208
Do what we say and you fucking live.

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:48.250
<i>Two black-and-whites en route.
Approximately two minutes away.</i>

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.417
<i>Two minutes dispatched.
Incoming ETA two minutes.</i>

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500
Two minutes.

00:02:52.583 --> 00:02:54.417
<i>Bravo, can you hear me?</i>

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.250
<i>- Fuck!
- Please respond.</i>

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.583
What the fuck is going on out there?

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:03.500
<i>He shot two fucking guards, Elvis.
He shot two fucking guards.</i>

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:06.000
<i>- Number One, are we good?
- Bravo, come in.</i>

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:07.583
- Are we good, Number One?
- We're good.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.458
<i>What's happening there?</i>

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:11.792
<i>Number One just shot a fucking kid.</i>

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.125
<i>He shot a fucking--</i>

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:16.625
<i>- What do you see?
- Incoming. Incoming.</i>

00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:18.667
- Elvis, what's the play?
- Incoming!

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.458
<i>- I'm on him.
- Take the legs.</i>

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:21.875
<i>Fuck!</i>

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.083
<i>- Oh, my God. What the fuck?
- I said the fucking legs.</i>

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:27.500
<i>Okay, we've got one minute. Let's go.</i>

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:30.250
<i>- Come on!
- Exit west. We gotta go. Come on!</i>

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.625
Let's go! Let's go!

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:51.875
Fortico Security specialize in armed guard
cash pick-up trucks and deliveries across L.A.

00:05:53.042 --> 00:05:55.917
Our clients are made up
of large scale retail department stores,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.417
marijuana dispensaries, cash vaults,
casinos, private banks.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.417
<i>Can I get another one? Thank you.</i>

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.125
We're not federal.

00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:06.167
We're essentially middle men.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.875
Hundreds of millions
shifting through here every week.

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.500
We got 12 trucks,
two or three guards in each.

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:13.708
A driver, a messenger and a guard.

00:06:13.792 --> 00:06:16.875
Each moving up to 15 mil a day
and sometimes more,

00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.375
which can attract unwanted attention.

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:21.792
I won't lie, it can be dangerous.

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:24.750
Which is why we train you properly
and pay the premium rates.

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.250
So we can all sleep better at night.

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:28.375
Thanks.

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:30.417
Now your background checks
came back fine.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.292
And your reference from
Orange Delta Security was impressive.

00:06:33.375 --> 00:06:34.958
That was a good company.

00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:36.625
I'm sorry to hear it went bust.

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:39.417
- Family?
- Married.

00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.125
- Divorced.
- No one else?

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:43.042
No.

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:46.625
Good. Stay focused. I like it.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:51.333
But just so you know,
we lost a couple of guards a while back.

00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:53.667
Killed on the job, a civilian too.

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:55.958
A fucking tragedy.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.667
And they still haven't
found the scum who did it.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:00.958
And that's why we've upped our game.

00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:02.708
Sixty hours of firearms training.

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:03.708
Patrick?

00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:06.250
Are you Patrick Hill?

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:08.625
Yeah, no, please, don't get up.
Good to meet you.

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:11.708
Let's see, Hill, Hill.

00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:14.750
H. I'm gonna call you H,
if that's okay.

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:16.792
They call me Bullet.

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:19.792
Which is ironic
because I certainly don't move like one.

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:21.917
- Are you ready for target practice?
- Ready.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.958
I saw you had your pistol license already.

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.417
So this is the pre-assignment
training course.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.792
We got eight hours together.

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.042
Popping cans off walls and the like.

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:33.458
You need to hit the 70% pass mark.

00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:36.750
There's some fitness which, by the looks of it,
shouldn't be a problem for you.

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:39.083
We just need to see
how you are under pressure.

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:40.792
Shall we get started?

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:42.125
Whatever you say, Bullet.

00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:03.167
That's quite enough of that.

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:18.042
Been a while, huh?

00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:20.917
Little practice, I'm sure you'll get there.

00:08:32.708 --> 00:08:37.208
Too far, too far.
Pull it up a little. Pull it up.

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:47.750
Look at that: 70%.

00:08:48.292 --> 00:08:49.583
You just slipped in.

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.417
Any less, we'd be doing this again.

00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:54.708
You won't be joining a Formula 1 team
any time soon,

00:08:54.792 --> 00:08:56.167
but you'll do for this job.

00:08:56.833 --> 00:08:58.208
Let's get you suited.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.667
<i>How many we've got coming?</i>

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:05.375
In that case I'll get three pounds of ribs
and a bucket of wings for the kids.

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:06.583
Cough up, Bullet.

00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:09.000
- Dude, I'm on the phone.
- I don't care. Thirty dollars.

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:10.125
- How much?
- Thirty bucks.

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:12.500
- Wait for it. Wait for it.
- Change.

00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:14.542
- Suplex!
- I want that money.

00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:17.167
- There you go, buddy.
- Give me the dollar, dollar.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.083
- Forty-one...
- Thank you.

00:09:19.167 --> 00:09:20.875
Forty-two's not gonna beat me.

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.875
- Fuck off, Dana.
- Come on.

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958
You're not supposed to be here, anyway.

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:27.667
No, I think it's you who's
in the wrong change room, Stuart.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.667
Come on, let's look lively, people.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.458
Chop-chop, show me your money.

00:09:32.542 --> 00:09:36.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a new addition.

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:38.917
- Here you go, Shirley.
- May I introduce H.

00:09:40.542 --> 00:09:41.708
Yeah, she'll do.

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:42.958
Put 'em down, Dana.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.417
Come on. I'll show you your locker.

00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:47.542
This one is yours.

00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:51.917
- You good?
- Yeah.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.083
Why, don't I look it?

00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:57.750
No, buddy, you look like
a shrink-wrapped Rolls-Royce

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:00.292
in contrast to this car crash.

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:03.125
Meet Hollow Bob and Boy Sweat Dave.

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:05.542
You look like you could do
some pull ups.

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:07.375
I put a 50 on you beating Boy Sweat here.

00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:09.917
What's the matter with him?
He looks good for it.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.667
Yeah, that's what Boy Sweat thinks.
But he's also a cock.

00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:15.583
- Who's a cock?
- You're a cock, Dave.

00:10:15.667 --> 00:10:17.708
I reckon our man here
could pull yours right off.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.583
- He looks like he could handle a cock.
- Yeah. Small hands.

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:23.750
Makes me very popular
and you look good.

00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:25.875
What's that?

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:29.958
I said...

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.625
I'm sure you'd win.

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:34.167
At what?

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:36.208
The pull ups.

00:10:39.458 --> 00:10:40.875
Oh, charming.

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:42.583
One of yours?

00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:44.083
I've been looking for him.

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:46.625
- I'll put him back in the collection.
- Glad I could help.

00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:48.458
You're making friends already.

00:10:48.542 --> 00:10:50.500
It's worth getting to know Dave.

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:53.333
He's quite entertaining
in an unintentional kind of way.

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:56.792
Yeah. He once killed a hamster
because he squeezed it too tight.

00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:59.333
He can't write
without sticking his tongue out.

00:10:59.417 --> 00:11:01.750
This is your temporary side arm.

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:03.333
Just fill you get your own.

00:11:03.417 --> 00:11:05.333
I need you to love it, respect it,

00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:07.375
and bring it back in one piece.

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.875
They want us back in one piece too?

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.750
- Do you have a problem?
- I don't know, do I?

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:15.833
What happens if we're pulling pistols
in a machine-gun fight?

00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:19.083
Then you retort
with a positive mental attitude.

00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:21.917
- Name?
- He's H.

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:23.708
H.

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:27.875
Like the bomb or like Jesus H.

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:32.083
Well, if you can mushroom cloud
or walk on water,

00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:34.000
what you worried about machine guns for?

00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:39.500
It's the rock star's first day.

00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:41.917
All right. Lucky I got a soft drop then.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Try to keep your piece strapped,
like he should have done on prom night.

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:46.750
You're just unhappy I'm happy.

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:49.917
Yeah, only man I know that married
the first woman he banged.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.875
You're a cynical old dog, Supe.

00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.125
But I still got plenty of bitches.

00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:55.292
Of course he does.

00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:05.625
Oh, that's nice.

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.750
- Who's your pal?
- I'll explain later.

00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:14.875
Jesus Christ,
at least try to look busy, Shirley.

00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:18.792
You're gonna love who your new partner is.

00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:20.458
Just tell me it ain't the limey.

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:22.208
Commando doof himself.

00:12:22.292 --> 00:12:23.208
Fuck!

00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:28.292
Boy Sweat, you'll be happy to hear
that H is replacing Sticky John.

00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:30.000
- Thank you, Stuart.
- Got it, Bullet.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.375
Stay out from under my feet
and we'll get along just fine.

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:35.958
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this job can be?

00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:37.208
Somewhat do, yeah.

00:12:37.292 --> 00:12:39.500
No, you have no idea.

00:12:39.583 --> 00:12:42.458
We ain't the predators, we're the prey.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.958
Boy Sweat's up front.
You jump in there with him.

00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:51.167
Whatever you say, boss.

00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:03.417
Hear about the guards that
were murdered? It happened down there.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.375
Come on, Dave, it's his first day.

00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:06.875
What? He needs to hear this.

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.375
Don't engage.
He'll forget what he said in a moment.

00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:11.042
I heard.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:13.792
It's a tragedy.

00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:18.875
What you didn't hear is that I was
meant to be driving the truck that day.

00:13:22.083 --> 00:13:23.667
Why wasn't you?

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.667
- I was sick.
- Hungover.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.750
Sick! All holes.

00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:30.792
The last thing I needed
was the feds in my face

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:32.917
trying to make out if I was involved.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.917
Lucky you had a strong alibi.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.250
Fuck you, Bullet.

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:38.583
He was staying at his mom's.

00:13:39.875 --> 00:13:41.500
She knows how I like my eggs.

00:13:46.208 --> 00:13:49.375
This is a $2 million pick up
for Bank of the U.S.

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:52.417
Dave will stay in the truck.
H, you're coming with me.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.208
You get to meet the lovely ladies
who work the tills.

00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:57.167
Just be wary of Hot Betty.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.000
If you're lucky,
she'll only take your fucking arm off.

00:14:02.292 --> 00:14:05.250
Godfrey, H. H, Godfrey.

00:14:05.333 --> 00:14:07.125
- H.
- Godfrey.

00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:08.583
X marks the spot.

00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:12.875
Godfrey, as always, a pleasure.

00:14:14.542 --> 00:14:16.458
I like the way you handle that cart.

00:14:16.542 --> 00:14:18.208
Where did you learn that technique?

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:20.333
Spent a lot of time in supermarkets.

00:14:21.083 --> 00:14:21.958
Shopping.

00:14:22.042 --> 00:14:25.000
I can picture it now.

00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:28.792
A paragon of modern man on a wild sojourn,

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:33.375
stalking down the aisles,
hunting for Pop-Tarts.

00:14:33.458 --> 00:14:35.667
Pop-Tarts are not really my poison, Bullet.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:42.083
I prefer to lose myself in the dizzy food coma
of synthetic cheese and impossible meat.

00:14:42.792 --> 00:14:45.292
What has the world come to?

00:14:45.375 --> 00:14:47.500
A direct line of evolution.

00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:49.375
From Paleolithic man...

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.250
to a diabetic house husband.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.083
- Harsh.
- But true.

00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:01.750
How'd your boy do?

00:15:02.542 --> 00:15:06.167
Did he survive the hostile territory
of Hot Betty and the menopausal MILFs?

00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:09.167
Did you make poo-poo
or is your diaper still clean?

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.542
He did just fine.

00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:13.042
Hot Betty almost slid off her seat.

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:15.167
So there's juice in the old raisin yet.

00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:32.292
<i>Wakey, wakey, Sticky.</i>

00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:37.667
2411. Clear to proceed.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.000
Pull in slowly this time, Boy Sweat.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.292
<i>Base, this is Gamma. Reporting back.</i>

00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:55.792
Copy that, Gamma.

00:15:56.542 --> 00:15:58.000
Who's that boyfriend of yours?

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:01.417
They always gotta see the driver
and messenger,

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.125
otherwise, you ain't getting in.

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:09.708
Okay, Gamma. You're clear.

00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:12.583
At least your boy didn't fuck that up.

00:16:13.458 --> 00:16:14.875
I still prefer Sticky John.

00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.458
Everyone prefers Sticky John.

00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:19.125
You're gonna love him, Dave.

00:16:19.208 --> 00:16:22.208
He's got that exotic European thing
working for him.

00:16:22.292 --> 00:16:24.042
It'll take you a while to dial in.

00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:25.917
Hasn't taken me very long.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.917
I don't care what you guys think.
That man's a dark horse.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.458
What do you mean by that?

00:16:31.542 --> 00:16:34.417
That cat's overqualified for this game.
He's got history.

00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:39.500
We're all overqualified for this game.
And we all got history.

00:16:42.083 --> 00:16:45.042
Beer and pool? Your first day is over.

00:16:46.208 --> 00:16:47.292
It's a tradition.

00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:49.667
Sure. Give me two minutes.

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:27.083
- Point of the game is to get the ball in the hole.
- Point of a woman is to shut the fuck up, Dana.

00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:30.375
Well, that Ivy League education
is really working for you, Boy Sweat.

00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:32.292
Pretty soon, you'll all be working for me.

00:17:32.375 --> 00:17:34.250
Power is in this big head here.

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:37.250
It's definitely not in your little head,
or you still blaming the beer?

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:41.292
Yo, you gonna take your shot or what?

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:44.375
At least I'll still be here next week
to take a shot.

00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:45.917
What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.792
He's already got your road job.

00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:49.833
Word around the pool table is

00:17:49.917 --> 00:17:51.250
boss has eyes for the new boy.

00:17:51.333 --> 00:17:54.333
What, flat-footed limey? I'd shit him.

00:17:54.417 --> 00:17:55.917
Maybe you should say that to his face.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.417
Maybe I will.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.667
I spy with my little eye that I smell fear.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.417
That doesn't make any sense.

00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:03.958
Hey, John.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:06.375
You're an idiot.

00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.250
Fucking assholes.

00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.250
Here comes the walk of shame.

00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:14.875
Yo, action man, can I buy you a beer?

00:18:16.167 --> 00:18:17.083
No.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:21.750
Sorry...

00:18:22.917 --> 00:18:23.750
You mind?

00:18:31.375 --> 00:18:34.125
So where did you work before then?

00:18:34.208 --> 00:18:38.417
Orange Delta Security, Europe.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.583
Jolly exciting, was it, mate?

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.375
Yeah, spectacular.

00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:52.375
You ain't much for talking,
are you, Mary Poppins?

00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:55.750
No, I can talk.
I just don't want to talk to you.

00:18:56.458 --> 00:18:57.917
Let me buy you a beer.

00:18:58.542 --> 00:19:00.500
Just make sure you drink it over there.

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:13.583
Anything else?

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.125
I gotta give it to you, H.

00:19:24.208 --> 00:19:26.500
You're a real social magician.

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.042
First, you take his job...

00:19:30.417 --> 00:19:33.000
and then you make him cry in his beer.

00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:56.917
What is taking him so long?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.583
It's a 10-grand drop. He should have
been back five minutes ago.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.542
Hey, Bullet, what's taking you so long?

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.750
Bullet, unless you found
some beautiful, blue-eyed Latino boy,

00:20:13.833 --> 00:20:15.083
you should be back by now.

00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:23.875
<i>Fucking fuck!</i>

00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:27.417
<i>Don't fucking look at me...</i>

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.208
<i>Dave.</i>

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:37.458
<i>They're gonna fucking kill me.</i>

00:20:41.167 --> 00:20:43.333
<i>Now listen to me, ladies,</i>

00:20:43.417 --> 00:20:47.958
<i>if you want to see your girlfriend again,
you'll do exactly as I say.</i>

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:54.833
Um, I have to call this-- No...

00:20:55.458 --> 00:20:57.750
There's a protocol for this.
We have to drive away.

00:20:57.833 --> 00:20:58.917
Sorry?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.792
They don't want his 10 grand.
They don't want his 10 grand.

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:04.833
The money is in the truck. We have
2.5 million dollars. If we take it away,

00:21:04.917 --> 00:21:06.167
they're not gonna hurt him.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.167
Dave.

00:21:08.583 --> 00:21:11.917
You need to pull yourself together.
You need to reconsider this.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.792
Reconsider? That's why they have
the fucking policy!

00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:17.542
You don't want to do this?
Get out of the truck now.

00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:19.792
But we're not leaving him behind.

00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:22.333
He's one of us. It's only money.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.042
In short, I'm getting him back.

00:21:28.292 --> 00:21:33.417
<i>Stop fucking around.
You have one minute before she dies.</i>

00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:37.542
<i>Now turn the key and drive</i>

00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:40.875
<i>and I will tell you when to stop.</i>

00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:42.625
Are you gonna drive or you getting out?

00:21:43.458 --> 00:21:44.417
Oh, shit.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.167
This is such a bad idea.

00:22:01.042 --> 00:22:03.375
<i>Take the next left.</i>

00:22:20.333 --> 00:22:22.833
<i>Now stop the truck.</i>

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.333
All right. All right.

00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:40.000
<i>We got your fucking friend,
he don't mean shit to us.</i>

00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:41.500
They're serious.

00:22:42.542 --> 00:22:44.083
Shut the fuck up.

00:22:44.167 --> 00:22:47.042
<i>Open the fucking doors</i>

00:22:47.125 --> 00:22:50.125
<i>and pick up the money
and throw it in the flatbed.</i>

00:22:50.208 --> 00:22:52.917
You open up, they're just gonna kill us
and take the money, anyway.

00:22:54.333 --> 00:22:57.542
Dave, you just worry about putting your asshole
back in your asshole.

00:22:57.625 --> 00:22:58.833
And leave this to me.

00:23:00.375 --> 00:23:01.083
Fuck!

00:23:19.542 --> 00:23:21.292
- Fuck.
- This guy's fucking around.

00:23:21.375 --> 00:23:23.167
<i>- He's throwing bags on the floor.
- Goddamn it.</i>

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.708
Listen up, fuckboy.

00:23:24.792 --> 00:23:27.583
I said throw the money
in the fucking flatbed.

00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:31.708
Try to get clever again and old boy's
getting a face full of shit.

00:23:31.792 --> 00:23:33.125
<i>Don't be fucking slick.</i>

00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:35.833
Just do what he says.
These guys are fucking serious.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.542
Get it in the truck next time,
you fuck nut.

00:23:43.625 --> 00:23:44.500
Sorry, pal.

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.250
Fuck!

00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:52.542
Fuck.

00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:56.250
Put the gun down-- Take the money!

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.708
Please, stop!

00:24:00.792 --> 00:24:04.125
Give them the fucking money!
Are you fucking insane?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.542
Fuck!

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.750
Bullet! Bullet!

00:24:24.833 --> 00:24:26.542
Who is this fucking lunatic?

00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:50.292
Fuck!

00:24:54.917 --> 00:24:56.000
Who do you work for?

00:24:56.625 --> 00:24:58.792
Suck my fucking dick.

00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:00.458
What did you say?

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.292
I said suck my fucking dick.

00:25:04.375 --> 00:25:05.625
Suck your own dick.

00:25:16.875 --> 00:25:17.875
You all right, Dave?

00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:21.625
Did you make poo-poo?

00:25:39.417 --> 00:25:40.708
Thank you.

00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:48.833
Last but not least, Mr. Hill.

00:25:48.917 --> 00:25:51.042
Well, you're all
sticking to the same story.

00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:52.250
That's what happened.

00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:56.750
What I don't understand
is how you managed to take down six men

00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:58.333
without even so much as a scratch.

00:25:58.417 --> 00:26:00.042
You gotta admit it's impressive.

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:01.667
He saved his partner's life.

00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:04.542
What about your firearms experience?

00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:07.833
Your shooting
was unambiguously precise yet...

00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:11.458
your training scores were decidedly average.

00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:13.583
Barely even passed.

00:26:15.083 --> 00:26:16.458
Kill or be killed.

00:26:18.917 --> 00:26:20.708
Seemed to focus the mind.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.833
All right. Well, there's something else.

00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:30.875
I'd like you to take a look at this video.

00:26:30.958 --> 00:26:34.500
This is security footage from the raid
on the Fortico cash truck before,

00:26:34.583 --> 00:26:36.417
when the guards were killed.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.250
- I can't watch this again.
- Step outside, by all means.

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:44.583
We just want you to let us know
if you think there's any connection

00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:47.667
between this robbery
and the men you encountered before.

00:26:58.708 --> 00:27:00.833
You all right to keep watching?

00:27:01.917 --> 00:27:02.750
Yeah.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.833
I'm all right.

00:27:10.042 --> 00:27:11.125
Mr. Hill?

00:27:11.667 --> 00:27:13.042
Anything ringing a bell?

00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:18.542
Mr. Hill?

00:27:25.167 --> 00:27:27.333
- Any connection, Mr. Hill?
- No.

00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:30.417
You sure?

00:27:32.458 --> 00:27:33.375
I'm sure.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.083
All right, Mr. Hill,
we'll pick this up another day.

00:27:42.833 --> 00:27:45.292
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we'll be in touch.

00:27:45.958 --> 00:27:48.208
Visit the therapist. Rest up.

00:27:50.417 --> 00:27:52.083
Thank you, Mr. Hill.

00:27:57.583 --> 00:27:59.083
Patrick, can I have a word?

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.667
We have a policy.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.708
The shrinks advise that employees
be taken off the front line

00:28:05.792 --> 00:28:09.917
for a month following violent incidents,
and longer if lives are lost.

00:28:10.583 --> 00:28:13.333
So we're gonna transfer you to desk duty

00:28:13.417 --> 00:28:15.083
in case of PTSD.

00:28:15.167 --> 00:28:16.500
Do I look disturbed?

00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:20.792
No, you don't, but then
these things take time to manifest,

00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:21.917
to percolate.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.125
It's with your best interests at heart.

00:28:24.208 --> 00:28:26.917
You hired me to do a job, did a job.

00:28:27.917 --> 00:28:29.750
No, we hired you to move money.

00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:31.042
You hired me to protect money.

00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:32.500
Mr. Hill?

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.750
Hey, I'm Blake Halls. I own Fortico.

00:28:36.833 --> 00:28:40.292
I wanted to congratulate you for yesterday
and to thank you in person.

00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:41.875
What you did deserves credit.

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:44.375
You're a real hero,

00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:46.208
and that's not wasted on me.

00:28:47.083 --> 00:28:48.542
Take the rest of the day off

00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:51.583
while Terry and I discuss
your promising future.

00:28:54.417 --> 00:28:57.958
Terry, we need that guy in the field.

00:28:58.042 --> 00:29:00.792
If we'd had him last year,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

00:29:00.875 --> 00:29:02.542
He's exactly what we need.

00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:05.667
And the publicity for Fortico
has been very positive.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.875
Plus, have you heard the crews talking?
They're inspired.

00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:11.167
So don't punish him, promote him.

00:29:15.167 --> 00:29:18.167
<i>- Well?
- Yes, it was him.</i>

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:22.667
It had him written all over it.
Question is, what was he doing there?

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.375
I think we know
what he was doing there, boss.

00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:29.125
Clever fucking you, Hubbard.
It's called sarcasm.

00:29:29.208 --> 00:29:30.417
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.458
Not a fucking thing, let the painter paint.

00:29:32.542 --> 00:29:34.583
<i>Do you have any idea
what would happen to us</i>

00:29:34.667 --> 00:29:38.000
if anyone found out that
we let the fox in the fucking hen house?

00:29:39.125 --> 00:29:41.917
The bureau's been trying
to catch this man for 25 years.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.375
<i>We're just gonna let him
sit on hundreds of millions?</i>

00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:46.333
Money doesn't mean a thing to him.

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:48.333
Listen, there's a reason
why I chose you two,

00:29:48.417 --> 00:29:50.250
because we have the same priorities.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.125
<i>Now listen to me very carefully.</i>

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:56.833
As far as you're concerned, he's just
a regular guard doing a good job.

00:29:56.917 --> 00:29:58.125
Do we understand each other?

00:30:00.292 --> 00:30:01.375
Loud and clear.

00:30:04.292 --> 00:30:05.667
"Let the painter paint"?

00:30:07.333 --> 00:30:08.917
What the fuck does that look like?

00:30:24.708 --> 00:30:26.500
Fortico personnel files.

00:30:26.583 --> 00:30:29.167
Pictures of Dana's family.

00:30:29.917 --> 00:30:34.625
And... the autopsy report.

00:31:05.083 --> 00:31:08.792
<i>Show me your fucking ass.
Face down on the ground right now.</i>

00:31:12.042 --> 00:31:14.458
<i>Face on the fucking ground.</i>

00:31:24.167 --> 00:31:27.292
Seems you can walk on water after all.

00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:31.625
Keep up the good work, soldier.

00:31:31.708 --> 00:31:32.917
Nice one, man.

00:31:34.583 --> 00:31:36.958
Be my guest.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:40.750
All right, brother.

00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:44.083
Good job, man. Let's go.

00:31:46.917 --> 00:31:49.125
Jump on up, big boy.

00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:02.125
We should get takeout from the Blossom.

00:32:03.667 --> 00:32:06.667
The noodle soup at Neptune's is the bomb.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.083
I prefer the Blossom.

00:32:09.125 --> 00:32:09.958
All right.

00:32:10.917 --> 00:32:13.750
You're gonna call the order in?

00:32:13.833 --> 00:32:14.833
I'm busy.

00:32:16.375 --> 00:32:17.583
I can see that.

00:32:17.667 --> 00:32:18.792
Who's this joker?

00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:20.625
What the hell is going on?

00:32:20.708 --> 00:32:23.083
- Move! Get the fuck back.
- Get back!

00:32:25.417 --> 00:32:27.583
- Reverse. Reverse.
- I can't fucking see.

00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:36.000
Gamma to base, we have a code red.

00:32:36.083 --> 00:32:38.292
<i>Gamma, this is base.
What's your location, over?</i>

00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:39.292
Take cover!

00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:41.167
Chinatown, Broadway and Hill.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.000
Repeat, code red in progress.

00:32:44.083 --> 00:32:47.292
<i>Just follow procedures.
Stay in the truck, over.</i>

00:32:47.375 --> 00:32:50.250
<i>- Get out of the fucking truck!
- Police were dispatched.</i>

00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:52.708
Come on, get out of there.
Get out of the truck.

00:32:52.792 --> 00:32:54.708
<i>They're coming.</i>

00:32:54.792 --> 00:32:56.208
On the ground.

00:32:56.292 --> 00:32:58.250
Open the fucking doors.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.000
Get down!

00:33:01.833 --> 00:33:02.750
Get down!

00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:07.750
Get down on the ground.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.542
You got three seconds.

00:33:16.458 --> 00:33:19.292
So let me get this straight.

00:33:19.375 --> 00:33:20.792
They just walked away.

00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:23.708
Get in the fucking van! Move it!

00:33:23.792 --> 00:33:25.833
Let's fucking go now!

00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:35.333
Doors were open.

00:33:36.667 --> 00:33:38.208
What the fuck was it, Mike?

00:33:40.542 --> 00:33:41.750
It was the--

00:33:42.208 --> 00:33:43.042
Yeah.

00:33:44.208 --> 00:33:45.708
Turned back around and left.

00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:50.667
No, I'm sorry.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.958
But what Terry is trying to say
is that you're a legend.

00:33:54.042 --> 00:33:56.917
And if you keep this up,
you won't just be employee of the month.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.458
You'll have your own calendar
and merchandise.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.792
Now get out there and keep crushing it.

00:34:08.792 --> 00:34:10.417
Why are you so cynical?

00:34:11.083 --> 00:34:13.000
I'm starting to think he's a psychopath.

00:34:18.583 --> 00:34:20.458
I hear H is for hero.

00:34:22.167 --> 00:34:23.083
Drink?

00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:41.417
It doesn't feel right.

00:34:47.125 --> 00:34:49.208
<i>It was as if he recognized H.</i>

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.417
<i>Like he saw a dark spirit.</i>

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.208
What are you saying?

00:35:00.667 --> 00:35:02.208
<i>I don't know what I'm saying.</i>

00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:05.958
<i>He's not a cop.</i>

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.458
<i>Doesn't smell like a cop.</i>

00:35:10.833 --> 00:35:13.042
But if he's not a cop, what is he?

00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:16.917
He's a dark fucking spirit.

00:35:24.542 --> 00:35:25.500
Put that on.

00:35:26.917 --> 00:35:28.042
Meet me next door.

00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:32.750
I told you that first day.

00:35:33.708 --> 00:35:34.958
I don't trust him.

00:35:42.583 --> 00:35:44.042
What the hell are you doing?

00:35:44.125 --> 00:35:45.042
Sit down.

00:35:45.708 --> 00:35:47.500
I'm not sitting down.
I want to go back to bed.

00:35:47.583 --> 00:35:50.333
Dana, sit down.

00:36:14.417 --> 00:36:17.250
You've got ten seconds to explain this.

00:36:18.458 --> 00:36:20.292
I'm not telling you anything.

00:36:20.375 --> 00:36:22.458
Dana, it's very important...

00:36:23.083 --> 00:36:24.917
that you take my inquiry seriously.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.042
I take it very seriously
that you think you can interrogate me

00:36:28.125 --> 00:36:29.625
in my own fucking house.

00:36:33.917 --> 00:36:36.792
Jesus. Fuck! Jesus Christ.
It's my savings, all right?

00:36:36.875 --> 00:36:38.792
The fuck has it got to do with you?

00:36:38.875 --> 00:36:39.833
You're not listening.

00:36:39.917 --> 00:36:43.667
Fuck. All right. Okay, please, stop.

00:36:53.417 --> 00:36:54.667
Sit down.

00:36:59.375 --> 00:37:00.375
I found it.

00:37:01.208 --> 00:37:04.208
Okay, it was being signed for one day
by the staff at Crown Liquor.

00:37:04.292 --> 00:37:06.167
They missed it, it was in the trolley.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.542
- You stole it?
- Yeah, I fucking stole it.

00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:10.583
It's 125,000.

00:37:12.167 --> 00:37:13.833
It's my retirement fund.

00:37:14.958 --> 00:37:16.458
Working with anyone on the inside?

00:37:18.208 --> 00:37:19.292
No, what the fuck--?

00:37:21.042 --> 00:37:23.750
Think carefully
before you answer the question.

00:37:29.417 --> 00:37:30.625
No.

00:37:37.042 --> 00:37:38.667
The retirement fund is yours.

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:44.292
But if it comes to light that you're not
telling me something that I need to know...

00:37:46.417 --> 00:37:51.042
I want you to understand
how resourceful and serious I am.

00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:54.208
On the table's a picture of your parents.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.250
Had it taken last week.

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:59.083
I've got your contacts.

00:38:01.125 --> 00:38:02.125
I know who you love.

00:38:04.042 --> 00:38:05.833
And I do bear a grudge.

00:38:07.542 --> 00:38:09.000
Do we understand each other?

00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:12.375
Good.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.958
They're saying that climate change
is a natural phenomenon

00:38:24.042 --> 00:38:25.708
rather than an artificial phenomenon.

00:38:25.792 --> 00:38:28.958
So how do you explain global warming,
the ice caps melting?

00:38:29.042 --> 00:38:31.833
Well, what melts up there
reforms down there.

00:38:32.958 --> 00:38:36.042
Know why they call the Arctic "the Arctic,"
and the Antarctic "the Antarctic"?

00:38:36.583 --> 00:38:37.708
No, Dougie, I don't.

00:38:38.208 --> 00:38:40.208
That's why I pay for you
to go to good schools.

00:38:40.292 --> 00:38:43.042
<i>Arktos means "bear" in Greek,
ant means "without."</i>

00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:47.375
<i>Hence, antarktos: "without bears."</i>

00:38:48.417 --> 00:38:49.958
Up with, down without.

00:38:51.292 --> 00:38:54.208
Good news for ice cubes,
bad news for polar bears.

00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:58.000
- What time's the game start?
- Six-thirty. We've got ages.

00:38:58.083 --> 00:39:01.042
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know, grab some food?

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.542
Sure. Hello?

00:39:04.625 --> 00:39:06.833
<i>- Hi, sir.
- What is it, Mike?</i>

00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:15.667
Dougie, go get a coat, will you?

00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:17.750
It's not gonna rain.

00:39:18.458 --> 00:39:20.000
Dougie, coat.

00:39:20.083 --> 00:39:23.042
- But why?
- Because I'm your dad.

00:39:23.542 --> 00:39:24.542
And I said so.

00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:29.167
Get someone else to do it.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.458
I can't, boss, there is no one else.
It's gotta be you.

00:39:32.542 --> 00:39:34.417
Joe, two fucking minutes.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.708
<i>I'm with my son, Mike.</i>

00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:37.708
You know Dougie is over here on holiday

00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:39.417
and it's the only time I get to see him.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.458
It's your fucking job, you do it.

00:39:42.292 --> 00:39:43.333
<i>Understood.</i>

00:39:45.208 --> 00:39:48.375
Brendan was on it but he got knocked off
his bike by a drunk driver.

00:39:48.458 --> 00:39:51.583
Make sure the boss knows it's not my fault.

00:39:51.667 --> 00:39:52.667
It's a drunk driver.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.792
He's with the police now
making a statement,

00:39:54.875 --> 00:39:57.375
otherwise he'd find a way to be there.
There is no one else.

00:39:57.458 --> 00:40:00.625
<i>I'm out of town,
Moggy's surveilling the depot.</i>

00:40:01.625 --> 00:40:03.167
I'd help if I could, Mike,

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:05.333
but my eyeballs are on the depot.

00:40:05.417 --> 00:40:06.417
Then postpone it.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.250
<i>We can do that if you want
but it's gonna set us back three months of recon.</i>

00:40:10.333 --> 00:40:11.625
<i>We need to know the route.</i>

00:40:11.708 --> 00:40:14.792
<i>If they turn left or right,
that's all you have to witness.</i>

00:40:14.875 --> 00:40:18.792
And there's no danger to it at all.
You can stand back a thousand yards.

00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:20.833
Didn't you put trackers on the truck?

00:40:21.458 --> 00:40:24.000
<i>They scan the trucks every time
they return to the base.</i>

00:40:24.083 --> 00:40:27.208
<i>We can't do it digitally.
We've gotta put eyes on it.</i>

00:40:27.292 --> 00:40:28.333
And boss...

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.208
I'm tracking on your phone right now,

00:40:32.292 --> 00:40:33.917
you're blocks away, 10 minutes.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.625
<i>And I repeat, no danger.</i>

00:40:38.583 --> 00:40:39.583
Dad.

00:40:40.583 --> 00:40:41.792
- Happy?
- Happy.

00:40:53.458 --> 00:40:55.000
I'm starving, fancy a burrito?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.417
You don't even like burritos.

00:40:57.958 --> 00:40:59.542
I know, but I'm starving.

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:01.458
Sure.

00:41:07.083 --> 00:41:08.417
I'll be two minutes, okay?

00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:12.458
- Keep the doors locked, don't go anywhere.
- All right.

00:41:25.083 --> 00:41:27.042
- Yes, sir?
- Two burritos, please, sir.

00:41:27.125 --> 00:41:28.208
You got it.

00:41:28.292 --> 00:41:29.292
Go ahead, Mike.

00:41:29.833 --> 00:41:35.542
<i>I can see you there.
Now, is that some gates on your left side?</i>

00:41:38.042 --> 00:41:39.042
Yeah.

00:41:39.125 --> 00:41:42.417
<i>Now in a minute,
those said gates are gonna open.</i>

00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:45.292
<i>And that said minute is now.</i>

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:55.750
<i>All I need to know from you
is if that truck is turning left or right.</i>

00:42:01.292 --> 00:42:02.417
Right turn.

00:42:06.708 --> 00:42:08.458
You know, make your own cappuccino.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Oh, goddamn. Who is this?

00:42:30.792 --> 00:42:33.250
Yo! Out of the fucking car, come on.

00:42:33.333 --> 00:42:35.792
Don't fucking look at me!
Out of the fucking car.

00:42:38.542 --> 00:42:41.167
All right, Mike. Is my day done?

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:43.292
<i>You're call has been forwarded to--</i>

00:42:43.375 --> 00:42:46.917
Do you hear me? Out of the fucking car!
Face down, come on!

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.833
Show me your fucking hands!
Face down on the ground right now.

00:42:51.542 --> 00:42:53.958
- There you go.
- Do what we say and you'll live.

00:42:54.042 --> 00:42:55.708
Face to the fucking ground.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.500
Thank you.

00:43:11.708 --> 00:43:12.875
Fuck!

00:43:17.708 --> 00:43:18.833
Dougie?

00:44:55.542 --> 00:44:58.500
Try not to move too quickly.

00:44:58.583 --> 00:44:59.667
You're in a hospital.

00:45:00.708 --> 00:45:02.875
You were in an accident, you were shot at.

00:45:04.208 --> 00:45:05.958
Six bullets removed.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.208
<i>Three operations.</i>

00:45:08.875 --> 00:45:10.000
Two lifesaving.

00:45:10.792 --> 00:45:12.542
You lost a fifth of your blood.

00:45:14.083 --> 00:45:16.250
You've got a warrior spirit.

00:45:19.125 --> 00:45:20.292
What about my son?

00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:24.708
Dougie?

00:45:39.125 --> 00:45:40.750
<i>My beautiful boy.</i>

00:45:46.625 --> 00:45:48.083
<i>And now he's gone.</i>

00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:54.417
He looked up to you.

00:46:01.333 --> 00:46:02.708
Was obsessed with you.

00:46:08.875 --> 00:46:10.333
It wasn't my work, Jane.

00:46:16.083 --> 00:46:18.083
You killed our son.

00:46:31.292 --> 00:46:33.542
And still you have nothing to say.

00:46:42.417 --> 00:46:46.750
You are a cold, cold cunt.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.083
<i>My condolences for your loss.</i>

00:47:28.917 --> 00:47:31.583
<i>Before you ask,
we have no leads on this thing.</i>

00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:35.500
<i>Which is kind of strange
for a job this big.</i>

00:47:38.625 --> 00:47:40.292
Somebody knows something.

00:47:40.375 --> 00:47:41.833
Somebody always knows something.

00:47:41.917 --> 00:47:44.250
It's just I'm not allowed
to ask the hard questions.

00:47:52.042 --> 00:47:53.250
Here's the shit list.

00:47:54.167 --> 00:47:55.458
Knock yourself out.

00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:06.000
Need any of them to live?

00:48:06.958 --> 00:48:09.500
I don't miss anyone
that your boys have buried so far.

00:48:13.042 --> 00:48:15.208
Then you need to let me do this my way.

00:48:19.375 --> 00:48:21.083
I can do in two weeks

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:24.000
what you only wish
you could do in 20 years.

00:48:26.583 --> 00:48:29.167
If their names are on that list,
you can do your worst.

00:48:31.417 --> 00:48:34.625
Just be mindful
that I can only look confused for so long.

00:48:36.542 --> 00:48:37.667
The floor is yours.

00:48:54.583 --> 00:48:55.583
Brendan.

00:48:57.833 --> 00:48:59.417
You need to quit that.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.292
I can hardly breathe here.

00:49:02.583 --> 00:49:03.708
It wasn't your fault.

00:49:05.292 --> 00:49:06.708
It was a drunk driver.

00:49:08.208 --> 00:49:09.583
It's easy for you to say.

00:49:10.458 --> 00:49:12.708
It's his son, Moggy. His only son.

00:49:12.792 --> 00:49:14.292
Hey, we all fucked up.

00:49:14.917 --> 00:49:18.542
So let's accept the responsibility
and not turn on each other in there.

00:49:19.625 --> 00:49:22.292
Brendan, retain your dignity.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.042
It's a fucking tragedy, boss.

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:36.333
We all love Dougie.
And our sympathies run deep.

00:49:36.417 --> 00:49:38.125
It's more my fault than anyone's.

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:40.500
And we'll do anything
to find who's responsible.

00:49:44.208 --> 00:49:45.875
I need to know who pulled the trigger.

00:49:49.458 --> 00:49:50.583
I need a face.

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:52.250
Of course.

00:49:53.375 --> 00:49:56.042
And we've been on nothing else
trying to get answers.

00:49:56.792 --> 00:49:58.750
It's not any of the usual suspects.

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.458
You're gonna tell us what we want to know.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.417
This is your last chance.

00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:11.667
The tree has been shook.

00:50:12.917 --> 00:50:14.250
<i>And it's been shook hard.</i>

00:50:17.792 --> 00:50:18.792
I want a name.

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.750
Anyone with a skill set, with a form.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.250
We've run out of names.

00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:30.625
We've deployed large amounts of time,
money and effort

00:50:30.708 --> 00:50:32.167
<i>in the search for justice.</i>

00:50:34.625 --> 00:50:36.125
<i>It was a long list.</i>

00:50:36.917 --> 00:50:38.083
Not good enough.

00:50:38.167 --> 00:50:39.417
Understood.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.333
But we've scorched earth.

00:50:43.667 --> 00:50:45.083
No, it's not understood.

00:50:47.583 --> 00:50:49.792
You started by saying
you'd do anything.

00:50:49.875 --> 00:50:51.583
But what I'm hearing is

00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:54.083
you think you've done everything.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.750
Understood.

00:51:04.833 --> 00:51:07.333
<i>I hear the train a comin'</i>

00:51:09.417 --> 00:51:11.708
<i>It's rolling round the bend</i>

00:51:13.875 --> 00:51:16.333
<i>And I ain't seen the sunshine</i>

00:51:18.167 --> 00:51:20.458
<i>Since I don't know when</i>

00:51:22.583 --> 00:51:24.833
<i>I'm stuck in Folsom prison</i>

00:51:25.375 --> 00:51:28.250
<i>And time keeps draggin' on</i>

00:51:31.083 --> 00:51:33.708
<i>But that train keeps a-rollin'</i>

00:51:36.083 --> 00:51:38.833
<i>On down to San Antone</i>

00:51:40.333 --> 00:51:43.375
<i>On down to San Antone</i>

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:48.750
<i>When I was just a baby</i>

00:51:50.958 --> 00:51:52.958
<i>My mama told me, "Son"</i>

00:51:53.042 --> 00:51:55.417
- What the fuck?
- Make a sound and you're dead.

00:51:56.583 --> 00:51:58.167
<i>"Always be a good boy</i>

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:02.458
<i>Don't ever play with guns"</i>

00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:09.333
All right, Jerome, what do you think?
It's getting late. We all got places to go.

00:52:09.417 --> 00:52:12.042
Why don't you save us a lot of time
and you a lot of trouble

00:52:12.125 --> 00:52:13.667
and tell us what we need to know?

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:17.375
Trouble? You motherfuckers got no idea
how much trouble you're in.

00:52:18.083 --> 00:52:19.375
Do you know who the fuck I am?

00:52:19.458 --> 00:52:22.167
Yeah, I know exactly who you are
and that's why you're here.

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:25.042
So I can see it's gonna be a long night.
Let's get started.

00:52:25.958 --> 00:52:27.000
Bag him.

00:52:30.375 --> 00:52:33.417
No! Fuck you all!

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.375
<i>It's rolling round the bend</i>

00:52:37.708 --> 00:52:40.250
<i>And I ain't seen the sunshine</i>

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.083
<i>Since I don't know when</i>

00:52:46.833 --> 00:52:48.792
<i>When I was just a baby</i>

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.000
<i>My mama told me, "Son,</i>

00:52:55.583 --> 00:52:57.542
<i>Always be a good boy</i>

00:52:59.542 --> 00:53:02.000
<i>Don't ever play with guns"</i>

00:53:08.708 --> 00:53:10.083
All right, take it off.

00:53:24.667 --> 00:53:26.292
I don't think he knows anything.

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.292
We'll see about that.

00:53:40.292 --> 00:53:42.917
I hear you're a tough lad and a hard worker.

00:53:44.292 --> 00:53:45.292
Good for you.

00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:48.958
But you're still gonna give me a name.

00:53:51.958 --> 00:53:53.875
If not for your life, for hers.

00:53:57.042 --> 00:53:59.292
What the fuck! Don't touch her!

00:53:59.375 --> 00:54:01.917
I said don't touch her.
Don't fucking touch her!

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.667
- Leave her out of this!
- Bag her.

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:04.875
- No.
- No!

00:54:06.167 --> 00:54:09.000
All right! The only fucking name.

00:54:17.875 --> 00:54:19.000
Jackson brothers.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.875
If it's anyone, it's them.

00:54:36.875 --> 00:54:42.500
Fucking dark porn, trafficking,
witchcraft kids,

00:54:43.125 --> 00:54:47.167
home invasions,
he's talked about these cash trucks too.

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:50.792
But you did not hear this from me,
and if you did...

00:54:52.208 --> 00:54:53.042
kill me now.

00:55:02.583 --> 00:55:05.750
Give him 200 grand. Leave the keys in the car.

00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:24.042
Pass me the water.

00:55:26.542 --> 00:55:27.542
You all right?

00:55:30.375 --> 00:55:31.375
No, I'm not.

00:55:33.083 --> 00:55:34.292
It's a Shit Show.

00:55:36.083 --> 00:55:37.500
Fucking reptiles.

00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:42.625
There's kids involved.

00:55:46.208 --> 00:55:48.750
Got a feeling I'm gonna be cleaning up all day.

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:03.125
Mike.

00:56:56.667 --> 00:56:59.458
Here you go, sweetheart. Drink some water.

00:57:00.708 --> 00:57:01.833
There's a good girl.

00:57:33.958 --> 00:57:35.333
How much is in the pot?

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.958
I'd say 2.5.

00:57:40.292 --> 00:57:41.792
So what do you think?

00:57:43.875 --> 00:57:44.875
I think...

00:57:46.208 --> 00:57:47.333
it isn't them.

00:57:50.917 --> 00:57:52.583
You've got to tell the boss.

00:58:02.625 --> 00:58:06.250
They're filthy fucks.
And they have done trucks.

00:58:06.333 --> 00:58:09.375
But they ain't our men. That job was above them.

00:58:10.292 --> 00:58:12.333
They're more about the smash and grab.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:15.750
Looks like there's two and a half mil,
which they confessed to.

00:58:15.833 --> 00:58:16.750
But...

00:58:17.958 --> 00:58:19.458
What do you want me to do?

00:58:24.083 --> 00:58:25.958
Don't want you to do anything, Moggy.

00:58:43.167 --> 00:58:44.333
How old are these girls?

00:58:46.583 --> 00:58:47.625
Not old enough.

00:58:58.208 --> 00:58:59.583
Give the girls the cash.

00:59:00.458 --> 00:59:01.458
And let 'em go.

00:59:32.083 --> 00:59:34.208
Can I speak candidly, boss?

00:59:38.917 --> 00:59:40.833
I don't think we should do this again.

00:59:43.375 --> 00:59:44.958
Understandably, you're...

00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:48.750
you're not in your right mind just now, and...

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.625
you need a break.

00:59:54.708 --> 00:59:56.958
But we can't continue
to handle business this way.

00:59:57.042 --> 01:00:01.167
Otherwise, some fuckers are gonna come for us
before we can get to them.

01:00:04.542 --> 01:00:07.250
The truth? We need a different approach.

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:12.292
It's gotta be an inside job.

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.333
You're right, Mike.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.333
I shouldn't have got you involved.

01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:27.250
I'm gonna go back to London for a while.

01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:35.958
- Patrick.
- Patrick. I'm a Brit, not a Mick.

01:00:36.042 --> 01:00:37.125
So your mom's Irish.

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:41.083
Usual fare,
this time you're Patrick Hill from Lewisham.

01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:45.750
You've got a driver's license, passport,
IRS papers with a full tax history,

01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:47.167
and medical records.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.500
All your criminal checks are clean.

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:52.333
You've got 25 years' worth of employment.

01:00:52.833 --> 01:00:54.500
With references working in Europe

01:00:54.583 --> 01:00:57.083
and the same for the previous addresses too.

01:00:57.167 --> 01:01:02.667
Your employment history has been inserted
into the Delta Orange security system.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:07.167
80, should anyone check,
you've worked there for 11 years.

01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:09.500
You even finished college,

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:12.917
and have held the same gym membership
since 2011.

01:01:13.958 --> 01:01:17.792
As requested, you have your pistol license.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:20.833
And finally, the hotel has been arranged.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:23.625
It's another brand new you.

01:01:24.875 --> 01:01:26.042
Kirsty, one more thing.

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.333
Give me a copy of the coroner's report.

01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:35.583
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- Just do it.

01:01:36.417 --> 01:01:39.750
And your reference from Orange Delta
Security was impressive.

01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:42.292
- Family?
- Married. Divorced.

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:45.292
- Anyone else?
- No.

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:48.250
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hill.

01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:54.917
You ain't much for talking, are you,
Mary Poppins?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.500
Let me buy you a beer.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.333
Just make sure you drink it over there.

01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:09.667
The autopsy report.

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:13.208
<i>Show me your fucking hands!
Face down, on the ground, right now!</i>

01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:16.333
<i>Face to the fucking ground!</i>

01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:24.958
How you holding up, Sam?

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.708
What's to say?

01:02:27.792 --> 01:02:30.333
Wake up late, watch TV.

01:02:31.542 --> 01:02:33.333
Drink a beer and watch more TV.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:37.208
Maybe convince Ma to give me a few bucks
so I can buy more beer.

01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:40.583
Watch TV until I'm drunk enough to fall asleep.

01:02:42.167 --> 01:02:43.583
Did I mention I watch TV?

01:02:46.042 --> 01:02:47.667
You're awfully quiet, Brad.

01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:49.542
I'm not quiet.

01:02:50.708 --> 01:02:51.708
I'm bored.

01:02:52.208 --> 01:02:54.875
- Bored of what?
- Of not fucking working.

01:02:56.292 --> 01:03:00.042
I'm built for combat, not daytime TV.

01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:04.958
The Afghanis treated us better than our own.

01:03:06.542 --> 01:03:08.292
I wish I was back in the unit.

01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:12.125
Boredom is more dangerous than bullets.

01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:16.333
Give me an enemy I can fucking see.

01:03:20.833 --> 01:03:22.542
How about you, are you working, boss?

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:24.958
Still part-time at the mall.

01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:28.583
Costing more than I'm making.
If it wasn't for Amy's parents,

01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:30.708
we'd be on the street.

01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:35.167
Seems like Carlos is the only one
who landed on his feet with the oil tycoon.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:38.167
So I'm there from 6:00 in the morning
until 12:00 at night,

01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:40.500
this motherfucker is dripping in gold,

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.750
and I haven't seen a dollar
in overtime yet.

01:03:42.833 --> 01:03:45.542
One minute we're killing Arabs,
the next minute we're wiping their ass.

01:03:45.625 --> 01:03:47.625
Afghans aren't Arabs.

01:03:47.708 --> 01:03:50.208
They're not? What are they?

01:03:50.917 --> 01:03:51.917
Clue's in the name.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.667
Afghanis.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.750
Whatever. They're not Americans.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.125
Do you know what I want to do?

01:03:59.208 --> 01:04:01.125
I wanna lift one of those precious ornaments

01:04:01.208 --> 01:04:03.583
until I get my motherfucking overtime pay.

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:04.667
And why don't you?

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:07.375
Why don't I what?

01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:11.333
Make them pay.

01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:16.958
They owe us.

01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:20.417
Why are you asking me?

01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:22.708
Ask sarge.

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.417
Do they keep cash?

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:45.750
What's that?

01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:51.667
<i>That is it.</i>

01:04:52.917 --> 01:04:54.292
That's fucking what?

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:58.667
<i>That is what is left
after we've washed it through the system.</i>

01:04:59.292 --> 01:05:00.667
What's on the table?

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:02.000
<i>Hundred ten.</i>

01:05:03.042 --> 01:05:08.583
Two Rolexes, Patek.
Six-carat ring chains, 40 grand cash.

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:14.042
Wait a minute. I got hit over the head
and lost my job for, like, 18g's a piece?

01:05:14.833 --> 01:05:17.375
Thought we worked out
over half a million in solids?

01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:18.667
We did the leg work.

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:21.292
<i>- We made the calls...
- Number One.</i>

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:23.000
<i>- Go ahead, Four.
- Incoming.</i>

01:05:23.583 --> 01:05:27.375
We spent the sweat,
we dealt with the fence,

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:29.417
<i>that's what we get.</i>

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.500
<i>Salaam-alaikum.</i>

01:05:33.208 --> 01:05:34.500
Even split.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.167
We're not the mafia. We're soldiers.

01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:42.708
Nah, something ain't right here.

01:05:44.292 --> 01:05:46.833
- You're trying to say something, Jan?
- Fuck off, Jan.

01:05:48.333 --> 01:05:51.542
Go find another bone to chew,
you'll break your teeth on this one.

01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:53.542
And stand up when the boss is talking.

01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:05.542
We could change it though,
out out the middleman.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.625
What does that mean?

01:06:09.708 --> 01:06:10.958
<i>We want cash...</i>

01:06:13.042 --> 01:06:14.375
<i>we go after cash.</i>

01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:16.542
We've got a guy on the inside.

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:18.250
Inside of what?

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:21.417
Cash trucks.

01:06:25.792 --> 01:06:29.458
We took in 1.18 million.

01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:34.750
That's three years' worth of work
in one payday.

01:06:34.833 --> 01:06:39.208
$168,571 each.

01:06:39.292 --> 01:06:41.167
<i>That's a lot of paper right there.</i>

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:46.250
<i>- Hold on, that's seven ways, not six?
- Thirty seconds.</i>

01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:47.667
There might not be a middleman,

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:50.000
but there is a man on the inside,
he needs a slice.

01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:58.250
And who is this inside man?

01:06:59.792 --> 01:07:00.792
You don't need to know.

01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:06.375
Yes, motherfuckers, these are
guns and we'll not hesitate to kill you.

01:07:06.458 --> 01:07:08.167
Don't be a hero, it's not your money.

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:11.125
- Show me your hands.
- Put your hands behind your back.

01:07:11.208 --> 01:07:14.583
What's your driver's name?
If you lie to me, I'll fucking kill you.

01:07:14.667 --> 01:07:16.708
- Chad.
- Chad fucking what?

01:07:17.542 --> 01:07:19.375
- Chad Reed.
- Horrible name.

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:23.042
Gentlemen, we have found our opportunity
to stand tall again.

01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:27.167
<i>After years of taking it,
staring at our laces.</i>

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:30.625
<i>Don't quit your day job just yet.</i>

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:32.958
<i>Rhythm as normal, be smart.</i>

01:07:33.042 --> 01:07:35.000
Don't go buying anything flashy.

01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:37.583
Just what you absolutely need,
do you hear me, Jan?

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:40.583
Oh, yeah, loud and clear, boss.

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:43.750
<i>Groceries, good.</i>

01:07:43.833 --> 01:07:45.250
<i>Sports cars, bad.</i>

01:07:46.667 --> 01:07:49.875
<i>This isn't retirement money,
but if we play it right, it could be.</i>

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:52.292
Yo, Dave, come in.

01:07:55.958 --> 01:07:57.000
Come in, Dave.

01:07:57.083 --> 01:07:59.250
Just checking everything's as it should be.

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.708
<i>All good here, Chad.</i>

01:08:01.792 --> 01:08:03.125
Be out in two.

01:08:05.708 --> 01:08:07.500
Did that just go as smooth
as I thought it did?

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.250
Don't count your chickens just yet.

01:08:12.833 --> 01:08:13.667
Hold on.

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:17.750
Gentlemen, if I can just get your signatures.

01:08:17.833 --> 01:08:19.208
- How's it going?
- All right.

01:08:21.708 --> 01:08:22.833
- Fantastic.
- Thank you.

01:08:24.792 --> 01:08:28.583
I'm telling you now,
there's more gold in these hills.

01:08:29.083 --> 01:08:32.000
Yeah. We haven't even tapped into
our skill set.

01:08:32.083 --> 01:08:33.917
Monkeys could've done that job.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.167
- So let's push ourselves then.
- Easy, boys.

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:37.833
Walking before running.

01:08:38.542 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah, I don't know about you guys,

01:08:40.083 --> 01:08:43.458
but, I feel like I've been walking
for a long fucking time.

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:48.667
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:53.333
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:58.417
<i>Happy birthday, dear Jack</i>

01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.500
Happy birthday!

01:08:59.583 --> 01:09:05.708
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:09:06.833 --> 01:09:07.708
Yeah!

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:11.417
It's getting harder and harder.

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:17.125
<i>I know it is my birthday, but...</i>

01:09:18.208 --> 01:09:19.625
<i>I've got a present for you.</i>

01:09:20.833 --> 01:09:23.333
- What are you sitting on, old man?
- More work.

01:09:23.958 --> 01:09:25.792
But with a significant bump.

01:09:26.833 --> 01:09:28.000
It's another truck.

01:09:28.833 --> 01:09:30.833
This time there's gonna be
at least six mil inside.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.917
Now, we're talking.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.875
<i>Well, it's a lot more profitable
than killing Arabs.</i>

01:09:35.958 --> 01:09:37.500
And it makes my blood flow.

01:09:41.958 --> 01:09:43.333
Sweetheart, what about the kids?

01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:46.625
Yeah, feed them first. Bad animals, bad.

01:09:47.667 --> 01:09:49.875
- I'm sorry.
- Here, let me help you with--

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:53.750
<i>Is the intel good?</i>

01:09:55.167 --> 01:09:56.458
We've got a good inside man.

01:09:56.542 --> 01:09:59.708
<i>He's one of us,
served under me back in the day.</i>

01:09:59.792 --> 01:10:02.458
Well, I'm in.
I just want to get back in the field.

01:10:02.542 --> 01:10:06.958
I like the money but I fucking love a mission.

01:10:07.458 --> 01:10:08.708
Yeah, what's the downside?

01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:10.500
We're gonna be way more exposed.

01:10:11.042 --> 01:10:12.667
And it will warrant significant planning.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:15.708
There will be six weeks of training and recon.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:54.667
Three minutes.

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:04.250
Who the fuck are these clowns?

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:13.292
- Is it gonna be a problem?
- I don't think so.

01:11:14.167 --> 01:11:16.833
- Five, on the car. Handle it.
- On it.

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.000
Time to go to work, boys.

01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:24.500
Gotta get these hinges greased, man.

01:11:30.083 --> 01:11:31.250
What is this?

01:11:39.333 --> 01:11:41.250
- Freeway's gonna be backed up.
- Oh, fuck! Shit!

01:11:54.458 --> 01:11:56.583
Still no response.

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:04.750
Thirty seconds.

01:12:08.208 --> 01:12:10.333
Yo! Out of the fucking car, come on.

01:12:10.417 --> 01:12:12.583
Don't fucking look at me!
Out of the fucking car.

01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:15.167
Let's go, motherfucker.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:18.792
<i>- Portico 1377, alarm raised.
- Alarm registered.</i>

01:12:18.875 --> 01:12:20.167
Face the fucking ground!

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.500
- Tires now.
- Move!

01:12:23.833 --> 01:12:25.583
Do what we say and you fucking live.

01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:28.542
<i>Bravo, two black-and-whites,
en route, two minutes away.</i>

01:12:28.625 --> 01:12:29.958
Two units dispatched.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.875
Don't do it.

01:12:35.958 --> 01:12:37.750
- ETA two minutes.
- Two minutes.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.292
No!

01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:46.042
Fuck!

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:47.542
He shot two fucking guards, Elvis.

01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:50.583
<i>- He shot two fucking guards.
- Number One, are we good?</i>

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:53.667
Are we good, Number One?

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:54.875
We're good.

01:13:08.292 --> 01:13:11.500
Number One just shot a fucking kid!
He shot a fucking kid!

01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:13.042
Dougie!

01:13:13.125 --> 01:13:15.625
- Incoming! Incoming on the right!
- It's fine! Incoming!

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:17.542
<i>- I'm on it.
- Take the legs.</i>

01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:21.750
What the fuck did you just do?

01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:24.750
I said the fucking legs.
Three, take his gun.

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:27.500
<i>Okay, we've got one minute. Let's go!</i>

01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:30.417
<i>- Move.
- Exit west. We've got to go! Come on!</i>

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.000
- Let's go.
- Move! Move! Move!

01:13:32.083 --> 01:13:33.500
Let's go! Let's go!

01:14:15.833 --> 01:14:18.542
I'll tell you, man,
I'm surprised to hear from you.

01:14:19.125 --> 01:14:20.458
Glad we could all make it.

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:23.750
I'm glad that shit blew over.

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:28.292
You put us in a tight spot, Jan.
I'm not sure it has all blown over.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
You're lucky you still got a seat at this table.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:33.833
Got it.

01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:41.250
I think we all know we're gonna need
a pension fund.

01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:43.875
I can't say I wasn't pleased
to have this meeting.

01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:45.167
I was starting to itch.

01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:49.208
As we are aware, the bigger the reward,
the bigger the risk.

01:14:49.833 --> 01:14:52.917
- Everything comes with a price.
- Are you ready for that?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.792
'Cause there is no guarantee of success
on this one.

01:14:57.625 --> 01:15:00.125
None of this was ever really guaranteed,
was it, sarge?

01:15:02.375 --> 01:15:03.583
We've been through worse.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:06.708
Yeah, so lay it on us.
We're dying to find out.

01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:12.167
We do this right,
we'll never have to work again.

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.292
- Neither will our kids.
- If we get it wrong?

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:16.458
It's game over.

01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:21.167
So, what is it?

01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:28.583
We're not hitting a cash truck,
we're hitting them all.

01:15:29.667 --> 01:15:30.875
How is that possible?

01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:35.250
The depot, Black Friday.

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:39.792
How much?

01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:42.750
North of 150 million.

01:15:48.958 --> 01:15:51.208
We've got eight weeks of recon and planning.

01:15:54.458 --> 01:15:57.167
<i>- Base, this is Gamma reporting.
- Come in, over.</i>

01:16:07.833 --> 01:16:09.208
This way.

01:16:23.417 --> 01:16:27.000
That's 160 million divided seven ways.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.042
<i>We have every avenue covered.</i>

01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:31.625
- Coming, Mr. Rossi.
- Thank you, Mr. Hill.

01:16:31.708 --> 01:16:34.000
- Signing in.
- This is our best plan.

01:16:34.083 --> 01:16:37.750
Yeah. All this is for nothing
if our guy doesn't come through.

01:16:38.417 --> 01:16:40.417
Why does this room always smell so good?

01:16:40.917 --> 01:16:42.875
Maybe, one day,
my garden can smell like this.

01:16:42.958 --> 01:16:45.125
I hope you're not planning anything, Dave.

01:16:45.208 --> 01:16:49.083
Well, it's Black Friday tomorrow,
so, you'll have to wait and see.

01:16:49.167 --> 01:16:51.417
If I thought you were serious,
I'd have to report you.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.542
Of course I'm not serious. Or am I?

01:16:56.250 --> 01:16:59.667
Anyway, it's Action Man
you got to look out for, not me.

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.583
Yeah, colder than a reptile.

01:17:02.458 --> 01:17:04.167
Something's not right.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:07.500
Well, why do I get the feeling
your money's never been safer, Mr. Rossi?

01:17:07.583 --> 01:17:09.583
<i>You don't need to worry.</i>

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:11.625
He's greedier than you, Tom.
He'll come through.

01:17:12.417 --> 01:17:14.208
Okay, let's run through it one more time.

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:20.375
Have anyone see my clutch?

01:17:20.458 --> 01:17:22.625
- Your-- Your what?
- My purse, sweetheart.

01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:24.083
There's a green one on the landing.

01:17:24.167 --> 01:17:25.292
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

01:17:25.375 --> 01:17:26.333
Come on.

01:17:26.958 --> 01:17:28.917
- What are you doing today, Dad?
- I got work.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.250
- At the mall?
- That's right.

01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:32.833
Will you come to my game after?

01:17:32.917 --> 01:17:35.125
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:36.250
- Let's go.
- Come on.

01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:37.667
- Love you, Dad.
- Bye, love you.

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:38.875
- I love you.
- Love you, honey.

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:41.125
- Come on.
- Bye.

01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:45.250
- I'm gonna be late for work.
- I love you.

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:46.708
Hurry up, Mom!

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:48.792
Okay, bye.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.833
Come on, kids. Get in the car.

01:18:02.083 --> 01:18:04.042
We're all set on our end.

01:18:04.125 --> 01:18:06.125
I'm on my way to pick up Jan.

01:18:06.958 --> 01:18:08.333
Now it's all up to you.

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:14.792
Remember, take different routes there and back.

01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:18.083
Even a sniff of anything untoward,
you call it in.

01:18:18.708 --> 01:18:20.417
This is Black Friday.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:21.917
The tills will keep ringing.

01:18:22.708 --> 01:18:24.333
So don't take no chances.

01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:28.583
We got close to 180 million
coming in here today.

01:18:30.292 --> 01:18:31.250
Have you got it?

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:32.458
- Yes, sir.
- Got it.

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:36.333
I want everything and everyone back.

01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:38.208
Safe and sound.

01:18:38.833 --> 01:18:40.292
Let's get going, H.

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:52.083
What? You don't like it?

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:56.417
How does someone like you
afford a place like this?

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.875
And a $28,000 bike?

01:19:00.125 --> 01:19:01.333
Credit card.

01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:04.542
- Calm down, it's not in my name.
- Return it.

01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:09.417
Put the beers down.
Grab your gear and let's go.

01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:12.625
Let's go.

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:27.792
That's the last drop off.

01:19:48.792 --> 01:19:49.708
What is it?

01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.042
You know I like you, right, H?

01:19:57.625 --> 01:19:59.875
Well, there's something I need to tell you...

01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:01.583
about me.

01:20:04.208 --> 01:20:05.667
I've got some friends...

01:20:07.042 --> 01:20:08.333
I help them out.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.958
They help me out from time to time.

01:20:14.333 --> 01:20:15.500
My pals...

01:20:16.625 --> 01:20:18.875
I helped them get into the cash truck game...

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:21.042
in a manner of speaking...

01:20:23.042 --> 01:20:24.833
with me on the inside.

01:20:26.375 --> 01:20:27.292
You get me?

01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:30.583
No, Bullet.

01:20:32.417 --> 01:20:33.375
I don't.

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:36.958
I tell them which trucks to hit...

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:38.958
and they hit them.

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:43.333
The two guards being killed was necessary.

01:20:44.375 --> 01:20:46.000
The boy was unfortunate.

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:49.542
<i>But we're a winning team.</i>

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:52.375
<i>Militarily precise.</i>

01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:56.333
Are you with me now?

01:20:57.875 --> 01:20:58.750
Yeah.

01:21:01.333 --> 01:21:03.167
I'm with you, 100 percent.

01:21:05.417 --> 01:21:06.667
Continue.

01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:09.542
For starters, there are no bullets in your gun.

01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:11.667
Secondly, I have to tell you,

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:14.542
they will kill you if you don't comply.

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:17.042
So do as I say and you won't get hurt.

01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:21.875
Why do you need me?

01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:24.542
We need something super-sized,

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.417
so we can walk away for good.

01:21:29.292 --> 01:21:30.917
We want the jackpot.

01:21:33.875 --> 01:21:34.917
The depot.

01:21:36.542 --> 01:21:37.917
You want me to get you in?

01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:40.292
Then you can look the other way.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.000
When, Bullet?

01:21:46.708 --> 01:21:48.333
Today.

01:21:49.875 --> 01:21:51.375
There's no turning back.

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.500
What's in it for me?

01:21:57.542 --> 01:21:58.500
Your life.

01:22:04.417 --> 01:22:05.875
Do we have a deal?

01:22:13.167 --> 01:22:16.125
Yeah. We have a deal.

01:22:21.167 --> 01:22:22.833
<i>We're on. ETA, two minutes.</i>

01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:23.875
Covers.

01:22:55.833 --> 01:22:58.083
<i>Gamma, this is base.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.333
Base, this is Gamma, we copy. Over.

01:23:02.417 --> 01:23:05.542
Gamma, I lost camera signal in your truck.
What's happening there? Over.

01:23:05.625 --> 01:23:07.458
<i>There's nothing to worry about, base.</i>

01:23:07.542 --> 01:23:09.208
I'm fixing it as we speak.

01:23:09.292 --> 01:23:10.958
<i>Copy that, Gamma.</i>

01:23:11.042 --> 01:23:13.083
<i>Keep me updated,
this ain't the day for this shit.</i>

01:23:13.167 --> 01:23:14.333
<i>Do you understand me? Over.</i>

01:23:14.417 --> 01:23:17.833
Loud and clear.
I'll be in touch as soon as. Over.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:22.875
We're set.

01:23:22.958 --> 01:23:24.667
<i>Cameras are disarmed.</i>

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.708
We have four minutes to load.

01:23:27.875 --> 01:23:30.375
We meet here at Point A.

01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:32.333
Warn our hero not to get clever.

01:23:32.417 --> 01:23:35.542
We'll need him to get inside.
After that, if he twitches, kill him.

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:44.542
Just let them do their jobs, okay?

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:46.125
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

01:23:48.667 --> 01:23:49.917
<i>Hey, handsome.</i>

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.750
<i>Today is not the day to be a hero.</i>

01:23:53.833 --> 01:23:55.917
<i>There will be no other warnings.</i>

01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:59.125
<i>Am I clear?</i>

01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:01.792
<i>Show me your hands.</i>

01:24:04.292 --> 01:24:05.958
Play the game, H.

01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:26.500
If you're a good boy today...

01:24:27.792 --> 01:24:29.125
you'll see tomorrow.

01:24:42.333 --> 01:24:43.583
Then we divide.

01:24:43.667 --> 01:24:46.875
You, Brad, Carlos and Jan
are in the truck.

01:24:46.958 --> 01:24:48.875
Me and Sam follow in the Escalade.

01:25:16.667 --> 01:25:17.625
Be cool, H.

01:25:17.708 --> 01:25:19.792
2411, returning.

01:25:20.417 --> 01:25:22.292
Gamma, this is base. Go, over.

01:25:37.917 --> 01:25:40.625
- All good?
- Yeah, except the traffic.

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:42.500
- Dana, come give me a hand.
- No problem.

01:25:42.583 --> 01:25:45.792
Right. Let's relieve you of your burden.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.542
Base, this is Gamma, reporting.

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:03.208
All clear, Gamma.

01:26:05.125 --> 01:26:08.375
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

01:26:09.708 --> 01:26:13.833
<i>Gamma 2411 inside.
That's the last one for today.</i>

01:26:13.917 --> 01:26:17.417
Once we get pass the gates, it's only
a question of time before we're compromised.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.292
There's too many guards that we can't control.

01:26:19.375 --> 01:26:21.583
So we keep it quiet as long as possible.

01:26:21.667 --> 01:26:24.083
The men must be stealthy.
The longer they're stealthed,

01:26:24.167 --> 01:26:26.042
<i>the longer we live without drama.</i>

01:26:26.125 --> 01:26:27.458
Hey, Bullet.

01:26:27.542 --> 01:26:29.833
- All good?
- All good here, Supe.

01:26:30.667 --> 01:26:33.625
Move, move, now. Move. Go.

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:37.208
Don't you make a sound.

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:38.375
Down on the ground.

01:26:38.458 --> 01:26:39.292
Move.

01:26:40.458 --> 01:26:44.000
- Kneel down.
- Tip toe, tip toe, tip toe.

01:26:44.083 --> 01:26:45.875
We secure the safe first.

01:26:45.958 --> 01:26:47.375
That's Carlos and Jan's job.

01:26:47.458 --> 01:26:49.667
Okay, Dave,
that's all good and accounted for...

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:52.042
Hands in the motherfucking air.

01:26:52.125 --> 01:26:54.833
Place your weapons on the ground.
Slowly, slowly.

01:26:54.917 --> 01:26:58.000
- Do what he says.
- Take that weapon out, slide it over.

01:26:58.083 --> 01:26:59.875
Get over there. Get on the fucking ground.

01:26:59.958 --> 01:27:01.458
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:27:01.542 --> 01:27:04.708
Grab your gun, put it on the ground
and kick it to me, motherfucker.

01:27:04.792 --> 01:27:06.583
Do you wanna be a hero today?

01:27:06.667 --> 01:27:09.708
I'll put you on the front page of every
fucking newspaper in America. Try me.

01:27:15.125 --> 01:27:16.125
Get on the ground.

01:27:17.208 --> 01:27:18.042
All the way.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:22.000
Get your fucking ass on the ground.
Tie his ass up.

01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:29.917
Behave yourself.

01:27:32.042 --> 01:27:33.667
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:36.042
I need you to sign this birthday card
for the boss.

01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:38.958
Bring it up here and have a look at this.
This will make you laugh.

01:27:39.042 --> 01:27:41.292
You, Jan and Brad
will take the control room.

01:27:41.375 --> 01:27:44.167
<i>Bullet is hostage and shield.</i>

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.500
If that doesn't work, we blow our way in.

01:27:48.125 --> 01:27:49.500
Keep it fucking quiet.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Open the gate.

01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:02.167
Bob, what the fuck is going on?

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:04.167
<i>The keypad will present a challenge.</i>

01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:06.542
<i>The men that operate the armory
are hard-boiled.</i>

01:28:06.625 --> 01:28:08.542
They will not be scared of pulling the trigger.

01:28:08.625 --> 01:28:10.417
<i>At some point, they'll resist.</i>

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:14.250
Open the gate.
Or I'll blow his fucking head off.

01:28:14.958 --> 01:28:17.542
You have three seconds.

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:20.042
One! Two!

01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:22.208
- Three!
- Okay!

01:28:22.292 --> 01:28:24.208
- Putting the gun down.
- Open the gate.

01:28:24.292 --> 01:28:25.500
The keypad is out there.

01:28:25.583 --> 01:28:27.125
You use the keypad.

01:28:27.208 --> 01:28:28.500
It's on security lockdown.

01:28:28.583 --> 01:28:30.542
You use the fucking keypad.

01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:33.750
The rabbits have run, Number One.

01:28:33.833 --> 01:28:35.875
Two, breach the gate.

01:28:35.958 --> 01:28:39.167
At some point, we're gonna come under fire.
They've got long guns, they'll use them.

01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:41.333
Here you go. Take this.

01:28:41.417 --> 01:28:42.750
So we'll need ballistic plates.

01:28:42.833 --> 01:28:44.792
This is your last chance.

01:28:46.042 --> 01:28:47.542
I'll blow his head off.

01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:50.042
Bob, open the gate,
or they're gonna fucking kill me.

01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:51.583
Bullet, get down!

01:28:55.667 --> 01:28:56.750
Shit.

01:28:58.917 --> 01:28:59.958
Set!

01:29:05.375 --> 01:29:06.583
Nobody fucking move.

01:29:06.667 --> 01:29:08.875
Number Three, what's going on?

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.375
Don't do it!

01:29:15.542 --> 01:29:17.333
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:29:21.458 --> 01:29:22.542
Now!

01:29:33.958 --> 01:29:35.208
Move, now, move!

01:30:02.375 --> 01:30:04.583
Where are you hit? Where are you hit?

01:30:05.458 --> 01:30:08.375
Four is down. I repeat, Four is down.

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:15.958
Oh, no, no, no!

01:30:16.042 --> 01:30:18.458
No, please, sweet Mary and Joseph,
I swear to God.

01:30:18.542 --> 01:30:20.958
Look at this little Piggy.

01:30:21.042 --> 01:30:22.833
Please don't. I got kids, please.

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:26.750
- Yeah...
- Please, don't hurt me. Please.

01:30:30.167 --> 01:30:31.250
Enough of that.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.125
Elvis, come and play.

01:30:51.125 --> 01:30:54.333
<i>- One, sweep the rest of the building.
- Copy.</i>

01:31:02.542 --> 01:31:05.542
<i>- Five, are we good?
- Clear, Elvis, move in.</i>

01:31:12.917 --> 01:31:14.708
Welcome to the party.

01:31:15.333 --> 01:31:16.625
These three are hog tied.

01:31:16.708 --> 01:31:20.292
The block is in there,
and another three guards in the back.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.167
SWAT have been alerted.

01:31:38.458 --> 01:31:40.708
<i>SWAT have been notified.</i>

01:31:40.792 --> 01:31:42.167
<i>All units please respond.</i>

01:31:44.125 --> 01:31:46.417
<i>Once the alarm sounds,</i>

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:49.125
black-and-whites will be on scene within minutes.

01:31:49.208 --> 01:31:53.167
But they cannot enter the building.
Even if they could, they wouldn't dare.

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:56.708
However, they are not our problem.
We will have eight minutes

01:31:56.792 --> 01:31:58.417
until SWAT arrives.

01:32:00.875 --> 01:32:03.875
<i>We can punch through the black-and-whites
with an 18-ton cash truck,</i>

01:32:03.958 --> 01:32:06.083
<i>but the SWAT truck's a different story.</i>

01:32:06.167 --> 01:32:08.042
We cannot get pinned down.

01:32:08.125 --> 01:32:10.458
We gotta get out
before they seal the exit.

01:32:10.542 --> 01:32:12.458
We're eight minutes out. Eight minutes out.

01:32:12.542 --> 01:32:15.417
<i>We have men down.
Send back up right now. This is an emergency.</i>

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.833
They have heavy assault weapons
and they have body armor.

01:32:17.917 --> 01:32:19.958
<i>- Men are down.
- Hold your position.</i>

01:32:20.042 --> 01:32:21.083
They have...

01:32:21.167 --> 01:32:23.333
- Get in, get in.
- We're calling SWAT.

01:32:23.417 --> 01:32:24.458
I'm not waiting for SWAT.

01:32:24.542 --> 01:32:25.917
We have protocol. We wait for SWAT.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.417
- No, we gotta go now.
- Wait!

01:32:34.292 --> 01:32:38.042
Two, wait until we're loaded.
Then join Three in the truck.

01:32:38.125 --> 01:32:39.833
Nose to the fucking ground.

01:32:41.958 --> 01:32:43.000
Did I stutter?

01:32:49.833 --> 01:32:52.167
Load the van, Three. I'll get Five.

01:32:54.833 --> 01:32:56.583
What the fuck is going on out there?

01:32:56.667 --> 01:32:59.167
There's a guard out here.
Someone shoot this fucker.

01:33:10.625 --> 01:33:12.000
Please!

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:14.375
Shots have been fired.

01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:15.542
Shots have been fired.

01:33:27.417 --> 01:33:28.375
Seven minutes out.

01:33:35.375 --> 01:33:36.833
Fuck!

01:33:39.333 --> 01:33:40.667
Clear.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.667
Fuck this, I'm going out.

01:34:08.417 --> 01:34:10.917
Listen, the alarm's gone,
we should just wait for help.

01:34:12.125 --> 01:34:13.542
What do you want us to do?

01:34:16.333 --> 01:34:18.542
You can do whatever you fucking like.

01:34:27.583 --> 01:34:31.042
David, no, listen to me. They got body armor.
That gun will do nothing.

01:34:31.125 --> 01:34:33.750
And this is not your money. Let's go.

01:34:34.375 --> 01:34:36.250
Fucking go. Go, go!

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:43.292
We're six minutes out.

01:34:54.333 --> 01:34:59.333
One, Four is down. I repeat, Four is down.
Do you have eyes on Three?

01:35:00.875 --> 01:35:01.958
<i>Three respond.</i>

01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:05.292
Who's firing?

01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:14.458
<i>Copy that, all units...</i>

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:15.875
Three is down.

01:35:16.583 --> 01:35:18.708
We've got a rat on the loose.

01:35:20.125 --> 01:35:22.417
Elvis is leaving the building.

01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:26.667
David, just put the gun down and hide.

01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:29.708
- The SWAT team, they're on their way.
- If something goes down in the hallway,

01:35:29.792 --> 01:35:32.125
- I'm gonna shoot them, Terry.
- There's no need.

01:35:33.125 --> 01:35:34.833
Making my way to you now, Elvis.

01:35:37.208 --> 01:35:38.417
Fuck!

01:35:40.667 --> 01:35:42.292
Come on out, and you won't get hurt.

01:35:44.958 --> 01:35:47.000
Come on, come here.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:36:00.625 --> 01:36:03.917
- Move!
- Some SWAT, some choppers, bring someone in.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.750
Here, take this.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:17.667
Man down.

01:36:26.125 --> 01:36:27.500
Stay down.

01:36:32.708 --> 01:36:34.708
<i>- Four minutes out.
- We're four minutes out.</i>

01:36:59.125 --> 01:37:00.583
Help!

01:37:45.208 --> 01:37:46.333
Dave, are you all right?

01:37:46.417 --> 01:37:49.208
<i>SWAT team are three minutes away, find cover.</i>

01:37:58.208 --> 01:37:59.708
We're sitting ducks here.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.458
Give me a gun.

01:38:08.542 --> 01:38:10.167
Fucking...

01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:12.000
Give me a gun!

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.583
- Thank you.
- Bullet, what the--

01:38:17.917 --> 01:38:19.500
- Clear.
- We gotta move.

01:38:19.583 --> 01:38:20.708
Come on, get up. Move.

01:38:21.542 --> 01:38:23.833
We got two minutes until SWAT is here.

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:27.708
Clear!

01:38:30.417 --> 01:38:32.000
Stay with me, stay with me.

01:38:32.917 --> 01:38:33.875
Come on, come on.

01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:58.583
Four is down!

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.333
Hey, Boy Sweat! It's Bullet!

01:39:32.417 --> 01:39:33.250
Bullet?

01:39:35.833 --> 01:39:37.667
Come give me a hand.

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.042
Bullet! What the--

01:39:58.667 --> 01:39:59.583
You're good?

01:39:59.667 --> 01:40:01.375
We're good. Let's go.

01:40:22.542 --> 01:40:26.125
Once the truck is loaded and we're all in,
we punch through the black-and-whites.

01:40:26.208 --> 01:40:28.125
Exit right.

01:40:28.208 --> 01:40:30.750
They and the choppers will be in pursuit,

01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:33.375
but there's nothing they can do to stop us.

01:40:51.833 --> 01:40:53.333
Fuck!

01:40:59.292 --> 01:41:03.625
From here it's two klicks to meet
at rendez point to enter building D.

01:41:03.708 --> 01:41:05.917
The gates here will stop
any immediate intrusion.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.958
<i>Heading south on 405.
We have visual. We have four birds in the sky.</i>

01:41:12.875 --> 01:41:14.208
It doesn't change a thing.

01:41:14.292 --> 01:41:15.958
You stick to the plan.

01:41:18.417 --> 01:41:19.750
Get ready.

01:41:35.708 --> 01:41:39.458
We will have five minutes until SWAT breaches.

01:41:39.542 --> 01:41:42.333
They'll think we're trapped, shoot to kill,
but we won't be there.

01:41:42.417 --> 01:41:46.083
There's no way they can know about
this access tunnel underneath the basement.

01:41:46.167 --> 01:41:48.125
This doesn't come up on any blueprints.

01:41:48.208 --> 01:41:50.083
They stopped printing this back in '57.

01:41:50.167 --> 01:41:53.333
<i>We have them surrounded.
SWAT has arrived on scene.</i>

01:41:55.292 --> 01:41:57.667
A-Team, let's go. Into position.

01:42:03.292 --> 01:42:04.750
How are you doing, sarge?

01:42:07.917 --> 01:42:11.542
If I don't make it,
get back there and finish the job.

01:42:11.667 --> 01:42:14.083
<i>We are
stationary and setting up a blockade.</i>

01:42:14.167 --> 01:42:15.125
<i>Awaiting further orders.</i>

01:42:17.917 --> 01:42:18.833
Go.

01:42:22.125 --> 01:42:23.583
That's the last of it. Let's move.

01:42:23.667 --> 01:42:26.875
<i>- All units you are clear to fire.
- Roger, Dispatch.</i>

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.292
Okay, I'll get the boss.

01:42:47.625 --> 01:42:50.208
You're not gonna need that, sarge.

01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:18.208
<i>We all understand the risks.</i>

01:43:18.833 --> 01:43:20.542
Some of us won't make it.

01:43:21.875 --> 01:43:24.333
If there is a last man standing,

01:43:24.417 --> 01:43:27.083
it's his job to take care of the families.

01:43:27.167 --> 01:43:29.667
I wish I was confident that will happen, but...

01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:31.417
My only concern is Jan.

01:43:32.792 --> 01:43:37.333
<i>Strange things happen to men
when they smell that much cash.</i>

01:43:38.375 --> 01:43:41.833
He's a soldier.
In the end, he'll follow orders.

01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:47.958
- Where's the sarge'?
- He's not coming.

01:43:48.042 --> 01:43:51.583
- What do you mean he's not coming?
- He's fucking dead, Bullet.

01:44:20.042 --> 01:44:22.792
From here, we load the Can-Am quads,
ride three more klicks

01:44:22.875 --> 01:44:25.958
to the silver Prius, load the cash undercover.

01:44:26.917 --> 01:44:30.500
And whoever's left
takes the construction pickup.

01:45:11.417 --> 01:45:14.000
Too fucking slow.

01:45:39.833 --> 01:45:42.375
<i>All right, team.
Move in. Weapons ready.</i>

01:45:42.458 --> 01:45:46.417
<i>- Copy.
- Suspects still in vehicle. Moving in.</i>

01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.125
<i>- Move!
- Go.</i>

01:45:48.208 --> 01:45:49.833
<i>What the fuck...</i>

01:45:51.958 --> 01:45:53.125
<i>We got one dead suspect.</i>

01:45:53.208 --> 01:45:54.792
<i>The others are fucking gone.</i>

01:45:54.875 --> 01:45:56.375
<i>- We need more bodies down here.
- Shit.</i>

01:45:56.458 --> 01:45:58.875
<i>- There's tunnel's everywhere.
- Captain.</i>

01:45:58.958 --> 01:46:02.375
There's a network of underground tunnels.
It's like a fucking rabbit warren down there.

01:46:14.625 --> 01:46:18.583
<i>3737, we do not have visual.
We need more eyes in the sky.</i>

01:46:18.667 --> 01:46:22.208
<i>Copy that.
Additional air units covering Long Beach dock.</i>

01:46:22.292 --> 01:46:24.458
<i>We 're entering industrial unit
on Terminal Way.</i>

01:46:24.542 --> 01:46:28.125
<i>We need more choppers up here.
There are tunnels coming out everywhere.</i>

01:48:21.458 --> 01:48:23.042
Aren't you gonna answer it?

01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:35.042
What do you want?

01:48:38.292 --> 01:48:39.708
You here for the money?

01:48:41.167 --> 01:48:42.458
I don't want the money.

01:48:44.917 --> 01:48:46.375
I want you to read this.

01:48:58.708 --> 01:49:03.250
"Bullets A1 and A2 enter the right lung
causing collapse"?

01:49:03.958 --> 01:49:06.625
"Bullet B1 penetrated the liver.

01:49:07.542 --> 01:49:09.875
82 ruptured the spleen.

01:49:12.292 --> 01:49:16.583

01:49:17.292 --> 01:49:19.750
Cause of death. Blood loss and trauma.

01:49:20.333 --> 01:49:22.125

01:49:37.583 --> 01:49:38.667
In summary...

01:49:40.542 --> 01:49:41.667
The liver...

01:49:42.833 --> 01:49:47.417
the lungs, the spleen and the heart.

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.958
What the fuck do you want?

01:49:52.042 --> 01:49:53.458
I want your liver.

01:49:58.833 --> 01:49:59.875
Fuck you.

01:50:03.667 --> 01:50:05.125
The lungs...

01:50:12.208 --> 01:50:13.333
Spleen...

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:25.542
By the way...

01:50:28.958 --> 01:50:30.583
his name was Dougie.

01:51:21.167 --> 01:51:22.333
Are we done?

01:51:23.583 --> 01:51:24.708
We're done.
