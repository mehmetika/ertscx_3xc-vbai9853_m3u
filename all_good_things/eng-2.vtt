1
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,089
For the record,

2
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,694
tell the ladies
and gentlemen of the jury

3
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,524
your name.

4
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,225
Um, David Marks.

5
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,871
And where were you born?

6
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,098
Um, New York City.

7
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,076
Is your father still alive?

8
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,807
Yes sir.

9
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:25,213
Is your mother still alive?

10
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,618
No sir.

11
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,122
How old were you
when your mother died?

12
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,727
Um, seven.

13
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,898
Were you present when she died?

14
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,229
Yes sir.

15
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,667
And how did she die?

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,640
She died a violent death.

17
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,353
David, if you don't mind,

18
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,651
I'm going to ask you some more
about your past.

19
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,161
David?

20
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,965
I'm sorry?

21
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,002
Your past.

22
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,418
Yes, I'd like to make
a collect call, please.

23
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,611
David Marks.

24
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,918
Dad, David.

25
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,626
Huh?
How am I gonna do that?

26
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,663
I got on the tuxedo.

27
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,095
Can't we just call a plumber?

28
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,932
Yeah right,
why would we do that?

29
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,767
That doesn't make any sense.

30
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,967
Why would you send a plumber
to do a plumber's job, huh?

31
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,485
What are you
looking at, huh?

32
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,391
Hi.

33
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,064
Oh. Hi.

34
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,295
Um...

35
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,369
I've forgotten why I'm here.

36
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,526
I was gonna make
some coffee.

37
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,855
Excuse me?

38
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,656
Do you want coffee?
I was gonna make some.

39
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,992
No thank you.

40
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,498
Am I keeping you
from something?

41
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,405
Yeah.

42
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,776
But it's something
I'm dreading.

43
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,178
Hey, do you have
some kind of...

44
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,411
I don't know, something
I could put under here?

45
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,350
Uh, yeah.

46
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,854
Here.

47
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,559
So how long ago
did you move in?

48
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,290
- On Sunday.
- Oh.

49
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,026
- From where?
- Long Island.

50
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:46,138
- Oh.
- My mom's house.

51
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,608
- Are you done?
- I think I should stop.

52
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,270
You know?
I mean...

53
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,416
I'm not a plumber.

54
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,417
I mean, as you
might have guessed.

55
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,318
And I can't get a plumber
in here until Monday.

56
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,255
So, uh...

57
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,089
I guess what I've done

58
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,595
is, uh...

59
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,927
Do you want help
with that?

60
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,601
Yeah.

61
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,170
Uh, anyway, so I guess
what I did was

62
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,312
come out here to tell you
that you have a leak

63
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,572
and, uh,

64
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,478
that you should get it fixed.

65
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,122
You smell good.

66
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,025
You're gonna be late.

67
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,662
So?
I'm always late.

68
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,832
You could always
blame me.

69
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,605
Hi, David Marks.

70
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,539
Sir, right this way.

71
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,441
- Oh God.
- Oh look, there.

72
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,309
- Here, take this.
- Go easy on him.

73
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,610
Okay, I don't have to tell you...
just ignore him

74
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,309
and I apologize
for anything he says

75
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,977
between now
and the time we leave.

76
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,622
Late.

77
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,156
Always late.

78
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,887
Anybody who didn't know you would think
you were a busy man.

79
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,296
Oh, I see you brought a friend.

80
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,661
- Katie.
- Katie.

81
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,360
Your full name, dear, always.

82
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,368
Oh, Katherine McCarthy.

83
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,007
Well, what a lovely
young woman you are.

84
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,542
You've even managed to make
my vagabond son look handsome.

85
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,373
He is handsome.

86
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,380
David, I need you to meet
the next senator from New York.

87
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,542
And I didn't invite you here
to help you get laid.

88
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,179
- Ambassador Moynihan.
- Sanford, congratulations.

89
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,984
- Thank you. Welcome back.
- Thank you.

90
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,354
Liz. Always more gracious.

91
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,725
Ambassador, you remember
my eldest son David?

92
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,162
David the heir apparent.
Of course, how are you?

93
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,495
- Fine, thank you.
- Oh, and this is...

94
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,399
- Katherine McCarthy.
- Miss McCarthy.

95
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,699
- My wife Elizabeth.
- Ambassador.

96
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,173
- Ah, the man himself. Thank you.
- Here you go, Dad.

97
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,538
Thanks, Daniel.

98
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,407
Hey, shouldn't you be
wearing white gloves?

99
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,172
Screw you, David.

100
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,010
- Is that Irish?
- Excuse me?

101
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,415
Moynihan, is that
an Irish name?

102
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,521
Gaelic. Originally
Scottish-Gaelic.

103
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,089
But my family...

104
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,717
My friends,
a man who's old enough

105
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,922
to remember
how 42nd Street

106
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,364
used to be...
Sanford Marks!

107
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,707
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

108
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,740
My father had a vision
for Times Square

109
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,072
and he passed it on to me.

110
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,374
Where there are peep shows
and massage parlors,

111
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,815
I see Broadway theaters
restored to their former glory.

112
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,716
And where there are
dilapidated hotels,

113
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,119
I see gleaming
office towers

114
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:56,058
bustling with the important
business of this city.

115
00:09:56,229 --> 00:10:00,063
It's my hope I can help
breathe life

116
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,725
back into this neighborhood
that was so dear to my father,

117
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,771
a man who placed great trust
in me to carry on his legacy.

118
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,000
To Howard Marks.

119
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,446
David, tell me about
the family business.

120
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,742
Has the Marks Organization
always been

121
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,818
a powerful entity
in New York?

122
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,683
We were always in the top five or six

123
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,155
property owners
in Manhattan.

124
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,487
Was it work that you were interested in?

125
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,652
Um...

126
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,495
no sir.

127
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,294
- A health food store?
- Silly, right?

128
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,438
No, I...
I think that's great.

129
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,770
- Really?
- Yeah. Where?

130
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,677
I was thinking
in Vermont maybe.

131
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,879
What do you do?

132
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,985
I want to go
to medical school,

133
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,281
but since my dad died...

134
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,890
It funny how hard it is
just to do what you want, huh?

135
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,186
- Yeah.
- I bet you could do anything.

136
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,193
#Oklahoma, where the wind
comes sweeping down the plains #

137
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,461
# And the waving wheat #

138
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,571
# Can sure smell sweet #

139
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:16,038
# When the wind comes...
right behind the plains! #

140
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,507
# Then when we say-yyy #

141
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,306
# Hey, a-yip-i-o-ee-ay! #

142
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,642
# We're only singing #

143
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,647
# You're doing fine,
Oklahoma... #

144
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,513
Did your father approve

145
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,552
of you living with
Katherine McCarthy?

146
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,555
Well, he didn't really have
a problem with that,

147
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,660
but he wanted me to live in New York
and to go into the family business.

148
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,056
Thank you.

149
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,329
What did you do instead?

150
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,061
Katie and I moved to Vermont.

151
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:48,697
We lived this sort
of a back-to-the-land kind of lifestyle.

152
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:53,869
We bought a small piece of land
and we ran a health food store.

153
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,586
It's perfect.

154
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,702
She's certainly a very
enthusiastic young woman.

155
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,572
- Where did you find her?
- 53rd Street.

156
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,737
She had a leaky faucet.

157
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,407
Ah yes, the famous
leaky faucet of 53rd Street.

158
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,452
Aren't you sorry you gave up
a promising career

159
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,419
- in real estate?
- No.

160
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,320
You're ignoring
a very hard fact of life, David.

161
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,964
What's that?

162
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,431
- She's never gonna be one of us.
- No, I know.

163
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,968
Isn't that great?

164
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,943
Don't forget
your racquet.

165
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,792
...a million miles away.

166
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,592
It's just like picking off
another part of your forehead.

167
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,325
I'll burn you.
Just you.

168
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,629
The rest of you,
you're fine, but that part,

169
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,965
- forget it.
- David?

170
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,371
You're talking to yourself.

171
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,061
David, I hope you
brought an appetite!

172
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,662
The ham looks delicious, Mom.

173
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,197
...you squeeze one time
and you get ketchup and mustard,

174
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,335
I call it Kepustard.

175
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,062
Kepustard!

176
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,002
Katie, your brother's
going to be a millionaire.

177
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,972
- Pass that ham down.
- David,

178
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,668
what does your family
usually do for the holidays?

179
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,681
We're going... ahem.
We're going skiing.

180
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,250
Oh, skiing!

181
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,046
I'm gonna teach David
how to ski.

182
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,882
I'd be scared too.

183
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,322
- You look terrific.
- Thank you.

184
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,260
- Doesn't she look terrific?
- She's a beautiful girl.

185
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,335
The Marks family.
Marks.

186
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,997
Are you kidding?
They own half of Times Square.

187
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,370
Can we please
not talk about this now?

188
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,445
Which half of Times Square?
What are you talking about?

189
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,208
- I'm just saying.
- He's taking her to Paris.

190
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,409
- That's what she said.
- Hey!

191
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,555
Whatever happened to my trip to Paris?

192
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,452
You'd be lucky to get a trip
to Paris, New Jersey.

193
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,032
Mom's making coffee.

194
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,566
- What?
- Why are you hiding?

195
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,931
I'm not.

196
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,608
Is it awful?

197
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,208
Awful?
Is it awful?

198
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,540
No, it's not awful at all.

199
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,307
It's just different, that's all.

200
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,950
It's just very different.

201
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,109
You know,
everybody talks to each other

202
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,653
and there's a ham
with pineapples on it

203
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,950
with little cherries
in the middle.

204
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,593
- Cherries, I like those cherries.
- Yeah, I like them too.

205
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,991
It's just really different.

206
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,964
Will you marry me?

207
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,798
What?

208
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,770
Was that a yes?

209
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,095
- Thank you.
- This was nice.

210
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,498
Yeah.

211
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,866
We just wanted to do it,
to make it official.

212
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,446
It's $39.50 each.

213
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,947
That includes a generous tip.

214
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,011
Oh.

215
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,119
I'm sorry.

216
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,188
Yeah.

217
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,390
Thanks, Mom.

218
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,627
- You're welcome, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

219
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,795
You're welcome.

220
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,216
So the guy's not selling

221
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,515
and his kids are starving.
And he's sitting on the world's

222
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,248
most valuable butcher shop.

223
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,724
But my dad wouldn't give up.
He used to say

224
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,364
"There's always a way
to convince a holdout."

225
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,365
You know?
I came around.

226
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:19,062
Sooner or later everybody does.

227
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,930
Oh, David.

228
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,906
- Look who's here.
- Oh, speak of the devil.

229
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,079
Your grandfather
didn't come hat in hand

230
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,874
to ask me to join the firm.

231
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,448
It was understood.
I understood it.

232
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,017
Your brother understands it
and you do too.

233
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,746
We're happy here, okay?

234
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,949
- I'm subsidizing that.
- Yeah, only until we get settled.

235
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,117
Settled?
You think she's happy here?

236
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,698
- Isn't she?
- You think she had this dump in mind

237
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,427
when she left Mineola?
When she laid eyes on you?

238
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,264
No, she had more in mind

239
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,100
and she deserves better.
She's a beautiful woman.

240
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,708
Just like your mother.

241
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,878
- Thanks for visiting.
- Thank you, honey.

242
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,574
I'd better get back to work.

243
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,276
How do you think my son can
afford to live like this?

244
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,560
What?

245
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,603
Take me to the airport.

246
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,807
Best of luck. Do you have a place
picked out in New York yet?

247
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,918
No.

248
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,823
Then why did you sell it?

249
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,756
I guess I thought
it was what I should do.

250
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,488
And I went along
with my father's wishes

251
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,758
and I agreed to go
into the family business.

252
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,700
Some of our Times Square tenants
pay their rent in cash,

253
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,774
so you'll pick it up
in person.

254
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,104
Solly, give him
the address of the Luxor.

255
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,472
Sure.

256
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,013
When you get down there,
you'll see why I'm sending you.

257
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,117
These people are not
really corporate.

258
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,812
But these properties need
to pay for themselves.

259
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,389
That is, until we
tear 'em down.

260
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,992
And ultimately

261
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,686
I think maybe you can
manage the whole area.

262
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,730
Well, it's good to have
you here, son.

263
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,238
You keep Solly
in the loop, huh?

264
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,229
Explain to the jury, please,

265
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,024
what the family business
consisted of.

266
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,191
My grandfather owned land in Midtown

267
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,600
which was,
once upon a time, a farm.

268
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,673
And as the area developed,

269
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,367
we built apartments
and office buildings

270
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,343
and whatever
was appropriate for the time.

271
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,615
Here!

272
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,120
What did you do for
the Marks Organization?

273
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,455
Um, some leasing,
but mostly

274
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,687
you know,

275
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,560
bookkeeping.

276
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,806
I followed the kid all night.

277
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,707
Massage parlors,
peep shows,

278
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,939
porn theaters.

279
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,141
All people see are
the fancy office towers.

280
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:56,220
But Marks owns some
of the worst buildings in Times Square.

281
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,084
- He's the problem.
- What do you want from me?

282
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,988
We need to take
the offensive, Mr. Mayor.

283
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:05,460
- Let me use the police.
- Relax, Sidney.

284
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,656
We'll get what we want.

285
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,960
Remember,

286
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,434
we're just the custodians.

287
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,233
This guy owns the place.

288
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,174
Ow.

289
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,175
My eyes are closed.
- Close your eyes.

290
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,473
- My eyes are closed.
- I swear to God,

291
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,276
if I'm going to be
a captain of industry,

292
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,079
we might as well
enjoy the perks.

293
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,620
- You're looking.
- No I'm not.

294
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,154
Okay.

295
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,158
- Do you want to count it down?
- You do it.

296
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,523
- Five...
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,325
...four, three,

298
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,695
two,

299
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,131
one.

300
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,999
Open them.

301
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,276
Oh.

302
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,522
Ohh.

303
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,214
Oh my gosh.

304
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,729
You like it up there
or you want to come down?

305
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,332
- I want to come down.
- Come on down.

306
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,461
Hi.

307
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,940
It's gonna be
so beautiful here.

308
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,628
Do you ever think
about having kids?

309
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,958
Come on.

310
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,434
Don't you want
a little David

311
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,402
running around the house?

312
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,407
Pulling at your toes
in the morning?

313
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,638
Smushing food
in your hair?

314
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,624
Are you saying no?

315
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,788
Can't we just talk more
about the apartment

316
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,957
and, you know,

317
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,534
whether this is going
to be a dining room or a living room?

318
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:35,367
Or... you know?

319
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,806
Are you saying "not now"
about kids

320
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,845
or not ever?

321
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,878
Not ever.

322
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,725
David...

323
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,561
is there something
wrong with you?

324
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:18,081
Yeah.

325
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,679
There is something
wrong with me.

326
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,773
Are you saying no?

327
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,117
David?

328
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,764
Yeah?

329
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,066
Are you okay?

330
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,433
David, did you ever have

331
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,936
any kind of psychiatric treatment?

332
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:18,804
Well, after my mother died,
I was sent to psychiatrists.

333
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,140
A lot of them, actually.

334
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,947
I didn't find them
very helpful.

335
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,211
Was there anyone in your life

336
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:31,254
with whom you did
talk openly about your past?

337
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,482
David, you cocksucker!

338
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,889
Get over here
and give me a hug.

339
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,893
# Boogie! #

340
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,659
# Get down,
boogie oogie oogie... #

341
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,463
- How are you?
- # Get down #

342
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,628
# Boogie oogie oogie #

343
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,740
# Get down #

344
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,274
- # Boogie oogie oogie... #
- Look at her.

345
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,311
I swear to God,
I had no idea

346
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,574
that people like her
even existed.

347
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,013
She's perfect.

348
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,244
What do you mean by perfect?

349
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,787
I mean there's nothing that
I do that she doesn't like.

350
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,127
She hasn't known you
long enough.

351
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:19,971
It must be so exciting,
having your first book published?

352
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,664
You know, I was thinking
of taking some classes.

353
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:26,038
- Maybe premed.
- How's, uh...

354
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,146
how's David doing
working for his dad?

355
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,842
Oh, he doesn't say
or he just says "Okay."

356
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,453
Well, that's him.
It's like...

357
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:39,113
like when he lost his mother.

358
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:42,158
- When did she pass away?
- Pass away?

359
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,386
She jumped off the roof,

360
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,726
cracked her skull open like
a walnut on the driveway.

361
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,691
David saw the whole thing.

362
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,236
He hid under a table for a week.
When he came out, it was...

363
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,136
it was like he never had one.

364
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,378
One what?

365
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,411
A mother.

366
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,914
And... and that was it.

367
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,010
Excuse me, Katie.

368
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,318
Smile.

369
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,057
She's very sweet.

370
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,726
- Unbelievable.
- What?

371
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:29,067
You're the only person I know that can
say "sweet" like you're cursing.

372
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,709
I did...
sweet is a great thing.

373
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,209
- I wish I was sweet.
- Yeah, I wish you were sweet too.

374
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,744
- Mm-hmm.
- What'd you say to her?

375
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,779
Nothing.
I didn't say anything to her.

376
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,418
- We were just talking. I just met her.
- Nothing? Mm-hmm.

377
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,714
Anyway.

378
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,255
I've missed you.

379
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,122
Quit it! I'm being sweet.
I've missed you.

380
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,059
I've missed you too.

381
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,258
You surprised me a little.

382
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:00,735
You're married to
a nice blonde shiksa?

383
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,466
Well, I wouldn't put it like that.

384
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:06,907
You're working for...
you're working for your dad, David?

385
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,604
Which you said
you'd never do.

386
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,908
- When's the baby shower?
- Come on.

387
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,144
You know, it's still me.

388
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,723
Does that girl know
how fucked up you are?

389
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,918
No, we're gonna...
we're gonna straighten you out, David.

390
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,620
We are.
I know a great therapist

391
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,789
and you're gonna
love her because...

392
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,094
because she does house calls.

393
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,270
Try to focus
on your breathing.

394
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,944
It's not so much the memory,
but the feeling...

395
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,645
the feeling
the memory evokes.

396
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,687
Okay okay?

397
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,156
- Again?
- Yeah.

398
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,374
Shit.

399
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,894
Jesus.

400
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,047
How did you and Katie feel

401
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,318
about your new life in the city?

402
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,327
Well, New York commercial
real estate is very,

403
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,829
you know, it's button-down
and white shoe,

404
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,160
and I really wasn't
set up for that.

405
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,736
But Katie seemed
to like the city

406
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,237
and she'd fixed up
the apartment and...

407
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:19,241
and eventually we even ended up
buying a weekend place

408
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,538
on a lake in Westchester.

409
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,449
Am I...
am I overdressed?

410
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,287
You look beautiful.

411
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,262
Oh! This place must have
cost a pretty penny.

412
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,632
Do you think all of these people
drove up from the city?

413
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,296
# In the morning
you go gunning #

414
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,272
# For the man who stole
your water... #

415
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,469
Hey, we're looking for Katie.

416
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,978
Oh, my brother's here.

417
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,143
Come on.

418
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,547
- Katie.
- Hi.

419
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,780
# And the mourners
are all silent... #

420
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,981
Oh my God, disco people.

421
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,389
Honey, babe...

422
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:12,928
# But the hangman isn't hanging... #

423
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,066
You know, I really think
it's quite unique.

424
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,326
Of course I'd love
to pick your brain

425
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,665
- about the business plan.
- # Go back, Jack, do it again... #

426
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,329
Get up.
Dance with me.

427
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,907
# Wheel turnin'
round and round #

428
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,566
# You go back... #

429
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:29,441
Thank you for inviting us.

430
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,777
It's nice to finally
meet the neighbors.

431
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,014
Can I touch your belly?

432
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,349
Sure.

433
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:40,955
It's moving.

434
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,991
She's moving.

435
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,994
- How do you know?
- I just do.

436
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,797
Before we walked over,

437
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,267
Barry tried on
every shirt he owns.

438
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,303
We don't get out much.

439
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,341
Most of these people
are David's friends.

440
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,876
I don't even think
he knows half of them.

441
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,105
Oh, I thought
they were your friends.

442
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,714
Some of them.

443
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,113
I guess it's just the way
people act around you.

444
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,810
They sort of favor you.

445
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,484
Maybe because I'm pregnant.

446
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,559
Are you?!

447
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,992
You're the first person
I've told.

448
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,464
That's wonderful!
How far along are you?

449
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,364
I just found out.

450
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,165
Um, I don't know
how it happened.

451
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,137
It wasn't planned.

452
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,208
- That's not what I said.
- You said that you couldn't,

453
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,742
- that it wasn't possible.
- That's not what I said.

454
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,038
That there was
something wrong with you.

455
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,976
I didn't say that.

456
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,343
- Yes you did.
- What's the difference?

457
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,145
All the difference
in the world.

458
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,150
Look, um,

459
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,482
we've got
an apartment in Manhattan.

460
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,557
We got a house
in the country.

461
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:51,662
- We got a Mercedes.
- I don't care about all of that.

462
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,264
- You don't care...
- I care about you, David.

463
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,424
I want to have
your child. David!

464
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,433
Okay, if you don't care,
we'll just go back to Vermont.

465
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,003
Fine, we'll go back
to Vermont, fine.

466
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,606
We'll do whatever
you want to do.

467
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,005
Please, David.

468
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,274
It won't be like when you grew up.

469
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,851
What do you know about it?

470
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,088
I'm not blind.

471
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,084
David?

472
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,453
Look at me.

473
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,260
You make me out to be
this person

474
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,457
that you...

475
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,068
think that I am.

476
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,501
But I'm not that person.

477
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,439
You can ask me anything you want.
Anything, anything.

478
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,011
Anything and I'll do it.

479
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,983
Just don't ask me this.
I can't do this.

480
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,270
Are you ready?

481
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,318
Uh, I gotta make a stop.

482
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,188
On the way.

483
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,459
What are we doing here?

484
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,367
What is this place?

485
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,008
I gotta make a call.

486
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,583
I'm at the Luxor
and there's cops everywhere.

487
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,517
Listen to me, go over to the Avon.
They may be next.

488
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,715
No, you gotta find somebody else, okay?
I gotta take Katie somewhere.

489
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,917
What the hell are you
talking about?

490
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:38,426
The mayor's not available.

491
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:42,396
David, get your ass over
to the Avon and pick up the cash!

492
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,159
Jeez!

493
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,079
Uh...

494
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,714
you go ahead

495
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,611
and I'll be
right behind you, okay?

496
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,048
I'll be there.

497
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,560
Mr. Marks?

498
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,430
Mrs. Marks?

499
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,802
I'm sorry,

500
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,608
we'll have to get started.

501
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,427
David!

502
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,264
Hey, David, David.

503
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,767
Hey, if it isn't
the happy couple.

504
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,337
They can't seat us
for like an hour.

505
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,939
Do you mind, David?
Is that okay?

506
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,804
Uh, can we pull a chair over here,
please? Is that okay? Thank you.

507
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,471
- Thank you, thank you.
- My pleasure.

508
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,611
So I heard about
all the excitement today.

509
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,381
Your old man must have had
you running all over town.

510
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:54,026
Sit. I'll go.
I'll go, I'll go.

511
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,689
What is wrong with you?

512
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,211
I'm sorry.
That's just Todd.

513
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,580
He is completely unaware
of anyone else around him.

514
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,812
Which just

515
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,321
makes him an asshole.

516
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,857
Let's step
into my office.

517
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,361
Come on,
it'll cheer you up.

518
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,365
Have you done this before?

519
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,267
No.

520
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,870
You're just gonna
snort it back fast,

521
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,035
like this.

522
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,846
Trust me,
whatever's on your mind now,

523
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:52,854
it won't be.

524
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,788
# Tonight #

525
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,019
# Last dance #

526
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:01,529
# Last chance for love... #

527
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,860
Do you want something?

528
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:09,605
# For romance tonight #

529
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,709
# Oh, I need you #

530
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,708
# By me #

531
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,939
# Beside me
to guide me #

532
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,209
# To hold me #

533
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,285
# To scold me #

534
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:26,787
# 'Cause when I'm bad,
I'm so so bad #

535
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,255
# So let's dance... #

536
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,158
tough comparisons
and increased piracy may help.

537
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:39,132
The inventory issue is
likely one time in nature.

538
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:42,273
However, piracy is an ongoing
problem for Microsoft.

539
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,908
The most damaging...

540
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,468
In the next few years,
how did things change?

541
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,972
We began sort of living
separate lives.

542
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,044
Katie lived at our lake house.
She was going to college near there.

543
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,010
So it made sense,
I guess, and...

544
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,847
I was still working in the city,
so that kept me busy.

545
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,289
Did you even tell him
you applied to medical school?

546
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,450
- Not yet.
- You have to tell him.

547
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,993
I know, I...

548
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,994
it's because of school,
you know.

549
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,032
I'm here during the week and we only
see each other on the weekends.

550
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:47,660
Yeah well, he's gonna find out anyway,
because you're gonna get in.

551
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,936
David?

552
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,411
What are you doing?

553
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,013
It was drifting away.

554
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,654
I don't want anybody
to steal it.

555
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,959
Oh, David.

556
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,305
Hi, you've reached David and Katie.

557
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:42,173
Leave a message.

558
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,837
Hi, it's me.
I don't know what time it is.

559
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,007
It's late.

560
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,153
It's so quiet here.

561
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,880
The smallest sounds
are keeping me up.

562
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:57,088
Anyway, I just wanted
to say I miss you

563
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,821
and I wanted
to hear your voice.

564
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,431
I hope you're still
coming tomorrow.

565
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,500
It would mean a lot to me.

566
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:25,249
Harriet, just say it.

567
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:27,357
You can enjoy smoking,
all right?

568
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:28,958
No, 'cause you
called me.

569
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,526
My little sister's going
to go to medical school.

570
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:33,129
Can you believe this?

571
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:36,198
Congratulations, David.
You must be so proud.

572
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,601
- Where is the campus?
- It's in the Bronx. It's in the city.

573
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,073
And it has one of the best
pediatric programs in the country.

574
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,703
Jim, I always thought you
would become the doctor.

575
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,111
Thank you, Ma. That's nice.
I feel much better about my life.

576
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:54,444
I'm kidding.

577
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:56,143
That's real nice, Mom.
It's all right, Jim.

578
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,050
Um, I can't find your jacket.
Do you know where you put it?

579
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,589
Oh, you're not leaving?

580
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,989
- No.
- Yes.

581
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,628
- I gotta drive...
- Sit down, David.

582
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,161
Come on,
what are you drinking?

583
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,730
I gotta drive all the way
back to the city. So, Katie?

584
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,629
Uh...

585
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:15,932
what? I... I...
I'm not going anywhere.

586
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,098
Jim, Jim, sit down.

587
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:21,302
- I'm just... I'll go start the car.
- Do whatever you want.

588
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,606
I'm not...
I'm not leaving yet.

589
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:31,278
What?

590
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,446
What is so important

591
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,149
that we have
to rush home for?

592
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:42,662
What, David?

593
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:52,138
I'll be waiting in the car.

594
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,711
"What's so important that we
have to rush home for?"

595
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:08,023
# That's the way I've always
heard it should be #

596
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:11,992
# You want to marry me... #

597
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,844
Where are you going?

598
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,543
Where you going to go?

599
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:39,087
Where you going to live?
'Cause if you leave me,

600
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,690
I'm not going to be able
to subsidize your lifestyle.

601
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,692
Which I don't think that you want.
I don't want that.

602
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,659
Look, can we just...

603
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:48,731
think about this
for a second?

604
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:53,369
I've never been
closer to anyone

605
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:57,371
and I don't know you at all.

606
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,941
Maybe I should go stay
at my mom's until I sort things out.

607
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,906
You're joking, right?

608
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:37,047
Why would you give up everything
you've done just because of him?

609
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,274
And you're not leaving
New York to move back to...

610
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,919
Long Island... yuck.

611
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,215
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
Your card was declined.

612
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,950
What? I...

613
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,890
- Try it again.
- Well, I already did.

614
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,087
- Um...
- I don't understand.

615
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,426
- Um...
- Do you have another card,

616
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,263
or cash?
It's only $22.75.

617
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,463
- I know how much it is.
- Here.

618
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,605
What the hell are you
looking at?

619
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,472
Eat your salad.

620
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:13,247
I just need enough money
to get through school.

621
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,817
Look, I'm trying
to explain.

622
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:19,319
Your husband is the beneficiary
of a number of family trusts,

623
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,253
most of which were set up
a long time ago.

624
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,756
I know that.

625
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:24,588
That means that as long
as you're married,

626
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:27,424
you can have access to his money,
but if you separate,

627
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:31,694
if you divorce him, you won't get any
money, because he doesn't have any.

628
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:33,530
Not of his own.

629
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,138
- Motherfuckers.
- Regardless,

630
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,276
families like the Marks
set their assets up this way

631
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:42,435
- to protect them from divorces.
- Motherfuckers!

632
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:45,480
Okay, could you just not...
just not do that?

633
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,850
These people play hardball.

634
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,886
If you want a settlement,

635
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,892
you're gonna have to think
of a way to motivate them.

636
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,639
How was your day?

637
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,641
Good.

638
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:28,018
I... had lunch
with Lauren today.

639
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,391
What else
did you do today?

640
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,508
What the hell is that?

641
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,878
Someone's on the terrace.

642
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,883
Call the police.

643
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,347
Oh God.

644
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:07,529
Jesus, Jesus.

645
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,757
What happened?

646
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:14,193
What the hell happened?

647
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,033
- Kel, call the police.
- No no.

648
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,402
No!
No no no. No no no...

649
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,807
Shh-shh, okay.

650
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,711
David.

651
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,947
Katie's next door
with us.

652
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,749
- She's scared to come home.
- Mm-hmm.

653
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,482
Well, we had a fight.

654
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,150
But it's nothing,
you know?

655
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,559
It's nothing.
I mean, it's not nothing,

656
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,756
but you can tell her
to come home. It's over.

657
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,730
Will you tell her
to come home, please?

658
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:47,063
Actually I think she should
stay with us tonight.

659
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,398
Just let things
cool off between you.

660
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:52,966
Thank you.

661
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,807
Good night.
Thank you.

662
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,360
- Hi, Lula.
- Hello, Mrs. Marks.

663
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,597
- Um, is David in?
- No, he's upstairs with his brother.

664
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:27,335
Okay, I'll be in his office.
I'm just gonna make some calls.

665
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:46,652
At the tone,
the time will be 11.59...

666
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:57,572
At the tone, the time
will be 11.59 and 20 seconds.

667
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:14,182
At the tone,
the time will be

668
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:17,350
11.59 and 40 seconds.

669
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,392
I'm going to lunch
now, Mrs. Marks.

670
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,195
Okay, Lula.

671
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,357
Thanks.

672
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,832
At the tone,
the time will be

673
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,776
...12.10 and 40 seconds.

674
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,474
Good evening,
Mrs. Marks.

675
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:36,184
- Send it back.
- Excuse me, sir?

676
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,693
It's a family matter.
It has nothing to do with us.

677
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,406
It's not just that you
barely show up for work

678
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:56,045
or that you can't control
your home situation,

679
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:58,909
when you are here,
you're stoned most of the time.

680
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,277
This is untenable.

681
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,578
There's an office on three.
It's out of the way.

682
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,723
No one will bother you.
You won't have to bother with anything.

683
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,324
You keep your secretary,
get your mail...

684
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,221
I don't know
what else to say.

685
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:16,131
Dad?

686
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,670
Why couldn't you just have
given her what she wanted?

687
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,817
You're a very
weak man, David.

688
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,817
Did there come a time

689
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:44,256
when your father passed on control
of the Marks Organization?

690
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:47,659
Not to you, but to
your younger brother?

691
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,130
Oh yeah, that's correct.

692
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,795
When that happened,
how did you feel?

693
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,339
I was glad.

694
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,681
Oh my God, Katie.

695
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:10,308
- I'm sorry.
- No no, you said you weren't coming.

696
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,717
Is everything okay?

697
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:15,187
Oh, I... I don't know.
No. Is Mom home?

698
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,385
No, she's still in Florida.

699
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:21,626
Oh!

700
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,528
I couldn't resist.

701
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:35,541
He...

702
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,907
died when I was 16.

703
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,410
Uh, I don't remember much.

704
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:44,850
10 years!

705
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:48,082
How did that happen,
you know?

706
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:51,318
And he does love me.

707
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:54,362
But I have to look out
for me now.

708
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,159
I have my whole
life to live.

709
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,001
My father used to say

710
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:04,504
"We should never regret
the things we do,

711
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,574
only the things
we don't do."

712
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:10,209
But...

713
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,440
I had... I had an abortion.

714
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,078
And I don't know
what that is.

715
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,952
If it's something I did,

716
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,117
or something I didn't do.

717
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:34,536
Hello?

718
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,433
David?

719
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,767
Katie?

720
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:41,240
Katie, don't cry.

721
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,436
Don't cry.

722
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,649
You have to let me go.

723
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:49,718
This is killing me.

724
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,751
Oh, I know, I know.

725
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,948
I know that now.
Just come home.

726
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:58,424
I can make this better,
I promise.

727
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:02,264
Baby, just come home. Please.

728
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,932
Please.

729
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,598
Katie?

730
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,466
Katie?

731
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,446
What are you looking at?

732
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:27,523
Katie? Hey, Katie,
where are you going?

733
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:29,784
I'm going home.
I'll call you in the morning.

734
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,121
You can't drive like this.
You've been drinking.

735
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,024
Come on.

736
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,767
Come on.

737
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,939
Hey.

738
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,102
What are you doing?

739
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:01,040
You hungry?

740
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,243
Where's Ivan?

741
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,548
Um... the kennel.

742
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:10,921
Oh, why?
You know he hates it there.

743
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,062
Yeah, I know,
but he bit me.

744
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,759
Here.

745
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,230
I'm cold.

746
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:38,780
What is it?

747
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:50,923
You would have made
a good mother.

748
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,899
So what am I doing here?

749
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:00,677
She must have hated you.

750
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,745
Your mother was
a very sick woman, David.

751
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:14,827
She wasn't always like that though.
She was happy.

752
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:23,032
I did everything I could
for her, just like I did for you.

753
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,602
Y-you... you let me, uh...

754
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:34,379
stay out there
and watch her jump.

755
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,215
I told the nanny
to take you inside.

756
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:44,090
That's not true.

757
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,561
You left me out there to watch.

758
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,226
I saw her there, you know?

759
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,807
On the driveway.

760
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,470
I thought
she was sleeping

761
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,137
so I tried
to wake her up.

762
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:08,614
- I touched her head...
- This is morbid.

763
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:11,083
Give me that.

764
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,556
How come you didn't
just pick me up, Dad?

765
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,319
How come you just didn't
take me inside?

766
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:33,798
I thought if she saw you
standing there...

767
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,138
she wouldn't jump.

768
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,130
I'm going to bed.

769
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,633
Go home to your wife.

770
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,300
She's gone.

771
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,543
What are you talking about?

772
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:13,174
Now I'm just like you.

773
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,747
David!

774
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:57,984
Something happened in 1982

775
01:09:58,161 --> 01:10:00,994
that kinda turned
your world upside down.

776
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:02,654
David!

777
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:04,823
Yes sir.

778
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,832
We, uh...

779
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:10,234
we went to the lake
for the weekend

780
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:13,398
and I put her on the train to go
back into the city that evening

781
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,010
and that was the last time
I ever saw her.

782
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:21,882
But according to statements
made to the police at the time

783
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,781
she was in fact
seen later that night

784
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,047
at your apartment in the city.

785
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,589
Miss Katie.

786
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:31,784
Yes sir.

787
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,131
Your doorman said
he saw her the next morning,

788
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,758
making a phone call
and getting into a taxicab.

789
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:42,461
Is that correct?

790
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,937
Uh, yeah, that's correct.

791
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:50,705
So at the time there was
a substantial investigation

792
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,280
into Katie's disappearance.

793
01:10:55,118 --> 01:10:56,881
Yes sir.

794
01:10:57,053 --> 01:11:00,147
And were you ever
considered a suspect?

795
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:04,883
No.

796
01:11:11,134 --> 01:11:12,726
As you know, Katherine Marks

797
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,836
has been missing now
for five days.

798
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:18,064
David, her husband,
is very distraught.

799
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:21,642
And so he's asked that I speak
to you on his behalf.

800
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:25,338
Now the Marks family is
offering a $15,000 reward

801
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:28,416
for any information
that leads

802
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,745
to the discovery
of Katie's whereabouts.

803
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,286
I'm sorry, but,
uh, for the moment

804
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,686
that's all I'm able
to tell you. Thank you.

805
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,326
Thank you. There'll be no more
questions at this time.

806
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,189
- Can we just get a phone number?
- Thank you.

807
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:42,797
Please, can you just respect
the family's need for privacy

808
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,432
at this very very
difficult time?

809
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,932
We'll keep you up to date
if anything new comes along.

810
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,809
Where are we going next?

811
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:04,317
Uh, we haven't covered
West End below 70th.

812
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,458
We can start again
early in the morning.

813
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:16,961
Yeah.

814
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,073
It's all right.

815
01:12:56,606 --> 01:13:00,064
So, David, I want to get you now

816
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:02,541
to the year 2000.

817
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:08,440
Um,

818
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:11,951
if I could have some water?

819
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,519
Right away.

820
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:24,966
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

821
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,398
Due to new evidence

822
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,231
and a close look
at the case,

823
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,396
I've decided to reopen
the investigation

824
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,270
into the disappearance
of Katherine Marks.

825
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:37,310
Katherine disappeared in 1982,

826
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,879
almost 20 years ago

827
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,312
and she remains
a missing person to this day.

828
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:44,976
Now there are plenty of people
who thought they got away with crimes

829
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,054
that we're now finding
can be solved

830
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:49,657
based on DNA
and other forensic evidence.

831
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,817
And I'm sure that puts a lot of people
on edge right now.

832
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:54,929
I'll take your questions.

833
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,661
Well, what did you
believe was going on?

834
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:02,133
Well, it was clear to me
that the district attorney

835
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:05,331
was reopening the investigation
to further her political career.

836
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:09,137
There wasn't anybody
who didn't know about it.

837
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:12,941
You couldn't walk down the street, you
couldn't walk past the newspaper stand.

838
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:16,312
It was just, you know,

839
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,316
everywhere.

840
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:20,819
What did you do then?

841
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,787
I...

842
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,519
intended to fill up my car

843
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:27,686
with clothing and linen
and go somewhere

844
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,831
and hide
and disguise myself.

845
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,694
It seemed to me

846
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,461
that the problem was
being David Marks...

847
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:39,006
so I just wanted not to be
David Marks anymore.

848
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,518
Hey!

849
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:02,163
Do you mind?
Can you just hold it down a little bit?

850
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,731
You know, it's just very
abrasive on my ears.

851
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,391
And you don't have to let
the door slam like that.

852
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:11,364
You know, I just need
a little consideration.

853
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,168
What?

854
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,571
So now you're living
in Galveston, Texas,

855
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:22,980
and you meet Malvern Bump
for the first time.

856
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,524
Did you pretend
to be mute?

857
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:36,055
Uh, yeah.

858
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:39,360
Yeah well, just be sure
and turn the hall light off

859
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,868
when you're coming and leaving,
'cause it's on my meter.

860
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,676
Do you think
Malvern believed you were a mute?

861
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:50,937
I doubt it.

862
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,741
Do you think
he believed you were a woman?

863
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:56,407
Probably not.

864
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,851
18 years ago this lakeside cottage

865
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:03,719
was a weekend retreat
for New York real estate heir

866
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:07,260
David Marks and his wife Katherine,
a beautiful young medical student.

867
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:11,059
Now according to Westchester County
District Attorney Janice Rizzo,

868
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,430
it is being considered
a possible crime scene.

869
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,094
Earlier today,
in an exhaustive search,

870
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:19,298
cadaver dogs uncovered a body.

871
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:22,137
Unfortunately
for hopeful investigators,

872
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:25,212
it was just the remains
of a dead dog.

873
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:28,407
Sources inside the DA's office say
that Rizzo's interest

874
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,553
in the case was triggered
by an unpublished manuscript

875
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,450
written by this woman,
Deborah Lehrman.

876
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:38,320
Lehrman's novel apparently describes
a murder, the details of which

877
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:39,825
are strikingly similar...

878
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:43,726
...to those surrounding the
disappearance of Katie Marks in 1982.

879
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,062
Investigators are also
interested in talking to David Marks,

880
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:50,000
but at the moment,
no one seems to be able to find him.

881
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:52,106
Reporting live...

882
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,799
Leave a message.

883
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:02,148
David, it's Deborah.

884
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:04,980
I can't believe
this is happening again.

885
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:07,179
I don't know
how people get my number.

886
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,482
First it was this...

887
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:10,352
it was this reporter

888
01:17:10,526 --> 01:17:12,460
and now a cop's calling
from New York

889
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:14,755
every five minutes.

890
01:17:16,532 --> 01:17:19,126
And I want to be there
for you, David, uh, I do,

891
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,792
but, uh...

892
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:26,465
I have my own problems now.
Fuck...

893
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,807
I had an accident.

894
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:32,447
It's nothing serious,
but my car needs...

895
01:17:32,615 --> 01:17:35,812
it needs some repairs.

896
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,816
As you know,

897
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:40,888
life in Los Angeles
without one is impossible.

898
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:42,785
Come on, let's go.

899
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,620
- And uh...
- Lulu, let's go. Oh fuck!

900
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:48,854
- Shit. Come on.
- I hate myself for asking, but...

901
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:50,965
I need more money.

902
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,499
Come on!

903
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:59,232
I don't know if this is record...

904
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,528
Leave a message.

905
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,901
David, why are you avoiding me?

906
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:34,042
I've always been
there for you.

907
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,110
I've been a good...
a good friend to you.

908
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:38,542
Don't you fucking...

909
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:45,580
Who says I'm bothering 'em?

910
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,221
I pay my rent
like everybody else.

911
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,118
You've got
30 days, Malvern!

912
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,089
I pay you! I pay good money
for this shithole!

913
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,092
Get away.
I got rights here.

914
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:57,562
What rights?
You got 30 days to get out, Malvern.

915
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,860
You're lucky I don't
call the cops.

916
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:02,435
- Where am I gonna go?
- Whatever.

917
01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:04,300
You got 30 days, Malvern.

918
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:07,033
And stop turning off
the goddamn light.

919
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:12,203
It's on my meter.

920
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:16,749
What sort of relationship

921
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,285
developed between
you and Malvern?

922
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:28,385
We became good friends.

923
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,175
Where the hell did you
learn to shoot like that?

924
01:19:51,687 --> 01:19:53,746
- The Purple Heart...
- I swear to God.

925
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:56,447
...for a sunburn.

926
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,025
And then we spent the entire war

927
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:02,186
shooting coconuts off
the side of the boat.

928
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:35,020
Why do you wear
all that shit for anyway?

929
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:38,956
What?

930
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:42,737
The girl stuff.

931
01:20:43,906 --> 01:20:45,737
You like that kind of thing?

932
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:51,345
No.

933
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:54,380
I guess...

934
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:00,253
I just kinda want to disappear
for a little while.

935
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:05,416
What about you?
Is that why you came out here?

936
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,093
Yeah.

937
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:14,201
Me, I...

938
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,038
I disappeared
a long time ago.

939
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:35,451
Oh.

940
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:38,616
You know,
I'm not always home

941
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:42,753
and I know how you like
to watch television.

942
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:45,764
So...

943
01:21:48,771 --> 01:21:51,205
You seem like someone
I can trust.

944
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:54,570
You know, I may need you to do
something for me one day.

945
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,539
Thanks.

946
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:15,757
In the days and weeks to come,

947
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,729
did Malvern become
aware that you had a lot of money?

948
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:21,267
I mean, he became aware that I was

949
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,837
planning on buying a house.

950
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:27,567
What effect
did you see that have on Malvern?

951
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:29,472
Uh...

952
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:32,239
well, Malvern had a problem.

953
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:33,938
He was getting evicted

954
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:36,414
and I guess he thought
I was gonna be the solution.

955
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:46,588
I can remember looking
at houses together,

956
01:22:46,762 --> 01:22:48,252
and, you know,
he was saying things like,

957
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,261
"Well, this would be
a good place for you to buy

958
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,263
because there'd be room
for me over there."

959
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:55,460
Yeah, it was
very uncomfortable.

960
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,276
This place might be
good for us, Malvern.

961
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:10,884
Leave a message.

962
01:23:11,053 --> 01:23:13,954
David, I need to see you.

963
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,454
You need to come out here.

964
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,889
If I don't hear from you, I...

965
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:20,722
I'm gonna blow
the lid off things.

966
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:23,228
You know what
I'm talking about.

967
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,481
David?

968
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:48,316
I know. David?

969
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:50,985
David!

970
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:54,356
You didn't give me time
to clean up.

971
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:57,727
- Turn that down.
- eclipse the 400,000 watermark

972
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,697
...to 411,000 last week...
- Cocksucker.

973
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,495
David, you're gonna
go deaf.

974
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,883
Leave a message.

975
01:24:53,055 --> 01:24:55,455
David, are you there?

976
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:59,754
Everything is taken care of.

977
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,328
You told me to call, so...

978
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,965
I'm calling.

979
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:07,567
I just need something to eat.

980
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:10,170
I haven't had anything to eat
and there's no food here.

981
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:12,637
So I thought, well,

982
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:14,776
maybe I'd stop
on the way back and...

983
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,320
Hello, yes,

984
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:39,524
my friend and I came to
your open house a few weeks ago,

985
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:42,431
uh, for unit 107.

986
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:45,869
Deborah Lehrman wasn't
just killed, it was an execution.

987
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:48,635
Her death is a very
questionable death, Michelle.

988
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,108
Not just in terms of the fact
that it was a homicide,

989
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:54,214
but the timing
is extremely curious.

990
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:57,147
Curious because
Deborah Lehrman was murdered

991
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:00,117
just before District Attorney
Janice Rizzo had

992
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:02,654
intended to question her
about another mystery...

993
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,621
the disappearance
20 years earlier

994
01:26:04,793 --> 01:26:08,126
of a beautiful young
medical student named Katherine...

995
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,762
Okay, you have
the "Post" interview, Marks,

996
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:51,269
then a phoner with W.I.N.S.
also about the Marks case,

997
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,499
which we can do
from the car.

998
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,540
We got a call
from Albany.

999
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,680
They want you to do
that meeting tonight.

1000
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,045
- Got the numbers I asked for?
- Yeah.

1001
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:05,186
They've been very
generous to the governor.

1002
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:06,843
Totals are in
the last column.

1003
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:09,547
These are all
from the Marks family?

1004
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:18,362
I'll have to change.

1005
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:30,972
Leave a message.

1006
01:27:31,146 --> 01:27:33,376
David?

1007
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,945
Come on, David.

1008
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:39,952
I know what's going on.

1009
01:27:40,122 --> 01:27:42,955
I talked to the broker.

1010
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:44,649
She said you...

1011
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:47,727
she says you never even
made an offer.

1012
01:27:48,964 --> 01:27:50,955
I trusted you.
We had a deal.

1013
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:55,331
Pick up the fucking phone!

1014
01:28:07,816 --> 01:28:09,181
- Hello.
- Mr. Sachs.

1015
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:11,410
- Solly. Good to see you.
- You too.

1016
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:13,110
- Pl-please.
- Yes.

1017
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,983
Oh.

1018
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:29,032
- No no, don't get up.
- Thank you for coming.

1019
01:28:29,204 --> 01:28:31,195
My pleasure.

1020
01:28:32,207 --> 01:28:34,175
Now what can I do for you?

1021
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:36,503
Some things
have been happening

1022
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:39,943
that have been
quite uncomfortable for my family.

1023
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,478
You want the ship to go down?
We're in a typhoon.

1024
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:10,975
So, David, on the night in question

1025
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:14,479
you came home and found
Malvern had been evicted.

1026
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:17,550
Uh, yes.

1027
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:23,524
Explain to the jury,
please, what happened then.

1028
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:31,192
...that pays attention
to my orders?

1029
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,529
Engine room reports
number one switchboard

1030
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:37,900
shorted out by saltwater.
Shifted to number two.

1031
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:42,909
Can't do much better
heading into the wind.

1032
01:29:43,078 --> 01:29:45,706
I trusted you!

1033
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,181
Fleet course is 1800.

1034
01:29:50,352 --> 01:29:52,843
Captain, we're in
serious trouble.

1035
01:29:53,021 --> 01:29:55,182
Mr. Marik, if you question
my decisions once more,

1036
01:29:55,357 --> 01:29:56,346
I'll order you off this bridge.

1037
01:29:56,524 --> 01:29:59,288
You're not giving orders on this bridge
anymore. I've relieved you...

1038
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:03,588
Mr. Marik, you're under arrest...

1039
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:05,756
So Malvern came at you with a gun?

1040
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:07,367
That's correct.

1041
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:11,096
He, uh, had been evicted

1042
01:30:11,273 --> 01:30:13,070
and he was desperate.

1043
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:20,371
He demanded that I

1044
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,812
take him in.

1045
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,884
And I just wasn't
gonna do that.

1046
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:32,286
Uh, there was a struggle

1047
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,759
and then the gun went off.

1048
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,631
All right then.

1049
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:45,898
If Malvern's death was
a matter of self-defense,

1050
01:30:46,074 --> 01:30:48,406
why didn't you call the police?

1051
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:51,511
Because I knew
that no one would believe me.

1052
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:55,343
I just knew that
no one would believe

1053
01:30:55,517 --> 01:30:58,179
that it was an accident.

1054
01:30:58,353 --> 01:31:01,584
So I had to get rid
of the body.

1055
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:24,544
So no one would
believe you because of your past?

1056
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:30,148
- I'm sorry?
- Your past.

1057
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,183
Now let's clear that up.

1058
01:31:32,354 --> 01:31:34,288
Set the record straight.

1059
01:31:34,456 --> 01:31:37,653
Did you kill your best friend
Deborah Lehrman?

1060
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:40,556
Um...

1061
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,489
David, you're gonna go deaf.

1062
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:49,901
No.

1063
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:54,705
Can you think of any
connection between the death

1064
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:58,972
of Deborah Lehrman and the disappearance
of your wife Katie Marks?

1065
01:32:13,161 --> 01:32:15,857
No sir.

1066
01:32:17,599 --> 01:32:21,057
David, is there anything
you would like to add?

1067
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:27,836
David!

1068
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:30,765
Anything else, David?

1069
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:33,964
No.

1070
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:38,302
Thank you, David.

1071
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,641
I have no more questions.

1072
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:22,041
I miss her so much.

1073
01:35:58,553 --> 01:36:02,216
# Glow my every night
my honey lemon died... #

1074
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:51,603
# Agents of the law #

1075
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:55,435
# Luckless pedestrian #

1076
01:36:57,712 --> 01:36:59,680
# I know you're out there #

1077
01:36:59,847 --> 01:37:03,806
# With rage in your eyes
and your megaphones #

1078
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:08,012
# Saying all is forgiven #

1079
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,981
# Mad Dog surrender #

1080
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:16,395
# How can I answer? #

1081
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:19,727
# A man of my mind
can do anything #

1082
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:24,702
# I'm a bookkeeper's son #

1083
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:27,204
# I don't want #

1084
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:29,070
# To shoot no one #

1085
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:33,407
# Well, I crossed my old man
back in Oregon #

1086
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:35,913
# Don't take me alive #

1087
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:41,485
# Got a case of dynamite #

1088
01:37:41,656 --> 01:37:45,251
# I could hold out
here all night #

1089
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:49,522
# Yes, I crossed my old man
back in Oregon #

1090
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,688
# Don't take me alive #

1091
01:37:57,739 --> 01:38:00,435
#Can you hear
the evil crowd? #

1092
01:38:01,943 --> 01:38:04,036
#The lies
and the laughter #

1093
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:08,374
# I hear my inside #

1094
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:11,950
# The mechanized hum
of another world #

1095
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:16,623
# Where no sun is shining #

1096
01:38:18,126 --> 01:38:20,390
# No red light flashing #

1097
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:24,428
# Here in this darkness #

1098
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:26,794
# I know what I've done #

1099
01:38:26,968 --> 01:38:29,528
# I know all at once who I am #

1100
01:38:29,704 --> 01:38:33,140
# I'm a bookkeeper's son #

1101
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:35,867
# I don't want #

1102
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:37,704
# To shoot no one #

1103
01:38:37,879 --> 01:38:41,872
# Well, I crossed my old man
back in Oregon #

1104
01:38:42,049 --> 01:38:43,914
# Don't take me alive #

1105
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:49,413
# Got a case of dynamite #

1106
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:53,617
# I could hold out
here all night #

1107
01:38:53,795 --> 01:38:57,492
# Yes, I crossed my old man
back in Oregon #

1108
01:38:57,665 --> 01:38:59,633
# Don't take me alive #

1109
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:03,996
# Don't take me alive. #
