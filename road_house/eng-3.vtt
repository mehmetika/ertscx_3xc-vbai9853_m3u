1
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:31,907
-  Come on, man!

2
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,509
Hi, excuse me.

3
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,013
Yeah, I'm looking for Carter Ford.

4
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,639
Do you mind pointing him out to me?

5
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,900
I hope he's not the bald one.

6
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,193
Guy with the ink.

7
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,402
He's takin' all comers.

8
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,127
Come on!

9
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,299
<i>A little
back-of-the-envelope arithmetic says</i>

10
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,345
<i>that's six in a row
for the illustrious Carter Ford.</i>

11
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,431
<i>Who wants to get in there,
make it seven, huh?</i>

12
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,808
<i>Who wants to do it?</i>

13
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,893
<i>It's winner-take-all tonight, y'all.</i>

14
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,520
<i>It's just a bunch of money in a bucket.</i>

15
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,273
<i>Carter Ford's got six.
Who's gonna get one?</i>

16
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,650
I'm gonna tape you. Arms flat.

17
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,443
-  <i>Someone step in.</i>
- No?

18
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,780
<i>Let's get this goin'!
Now, who wants to see another fight?</i>

19
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,032
- Fucking guy.
-  You ever done this before?

20
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,618
- Who the fuck is this?
-  All right, a superhero.

21
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,245
Close it up! Come on.

22
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,476
Jesus, Carter. You know who that is?

23
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,402
Nah. Nope.

24
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,363
I'm not fightin' that fucking guy.
No fuckin' way!

25
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,616
No fuckin' way. There's no fuckin' way.

26
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:19,700
Yeah, fuck you.

27
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,826
I don't give a fuck. I'm not...

28
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,411
- He's that fucking guy.
- You ain't gonna fight for your money?

29
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,662
Why would I fight that guy?

30
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,788
- Keep your fuckin' money!
- All right, get outta here.

31
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,290
I don't want your fuckin' money.

32
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,000
- You know who the fuck he is?
- Let's go.

33
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,920
I'll fight any fuckin' one of you.
I'll fuckin' beat your ass.

34
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,338
You fuckin' fight him!

35
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,173
-  Get your ass back in there!
- I'm not fightin' that fucking guy.

36
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,675
You can all go fuck yourselves! Fuck you!

37
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:37,718
Come on.

38
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:38,886
Fuck you!

39
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,179
Fuck you too!

40
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,353
- Fuck that shit! Bullshit!
- Get out! Get out!

41
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,980
There you go. Here's your money.

42
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,900
- No! Come on.
- I don't make the rules, honey.

43
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,912
Hey! Dalton!

44
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:07,873
Where you goin'?

45
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,002
You just lost me 500 bucks, asshole.

46
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,384
You sure you thought this
all the way through?

47
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,018
Hey, where you goin'?

48
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,020
You're not gonna take your knife?

49
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,071
Shit.

50
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,294
Excuse me.

51
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,509
It's a nice little scam
you got goin' on in there.

52
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,637
All you need is for the opponent
to know who you are...

53
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,014
Where is it?

54
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,391
Know your history,
and then they'll be too afraid to fight.

55
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,185
-  That's fuckin' brilliant, man.
-  Yeah.

56
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,646
Yeah, well, beats workin'.

57
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,442
You know, it actually
took me a second to recognize you.

58
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,485
Oh... Oh, God.

59
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,822
Um, do you need a ambulance
or something?

60
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,115
Nope.

61
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,742
You know you got
a big-ass knife stickin' outta you?

62
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,326
Can you hold this?

63
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,828
Sure.

64
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,330
It's gonna bleed when I take it out.

65
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh!

66
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,627
Oh, shit!

67
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,254
And <i>voil√†.</i>

68
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,468
It's gonna leave a nasty scar...

69
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,137
but it's easier this way.

70
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,223
- Wow, it seems like you do this a lot.
- Huh?

71
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,560
Yeah.

72
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,812
Patience and a keen interest
in the result...

73
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,689
that's all it takes.

74
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,651
So listen, I own a roadhouse.

75
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,195
Out in the Florida Keys.

76
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,362
A roadhouse, huh?

77
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,655
Hemingway used to drink there.

78
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,451
You know... Ernest Hemingway?

79
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,578
Good for you.

80
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,954
It's always been a rowdy place.

81
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,414
People come to blow off steam.

82
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,125
But lately it's been attractin'
the wrong clientele.

83
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,544
Come in every night. They trash the place.

84
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,004
The cops are no fuckin' help.

85
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,090
All my fuckin' bouncers have ran off.

86
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,341
Hand me that.

87
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,178
Anyway, I finally decided
I needed some outside help.

88
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,140
A friend of mine suggested
I come talk to some guy named Carter Ford.

89
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,560
Yeah, well...
Carter seems good with his hands.

90
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,229
No, you'd be better.

91
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,774
I can pay you good money.
5k a week... just for a month.

92
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,192
And I can put you up.

93
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,530
I'm all booked up. Sorry.

94
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,074
'Scuse me? I mean, it's 20 grand.

95
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,409
And judging by your car,
you need that shit.

96
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,702
Well, I like my car.

97
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,038
Okay, that's gotta be more
than you're makin' for...

98
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,414
whatever the hell you call this.

99
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,875
Try Carter.

100
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,252
Look, at least let me text you my number.

101
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,420
I don't have a phone, so...

102
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,505
Well, hold on.

103
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,299
I'll write it down on a pen and paper,
just like our ancestors did.

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,803
I'm Frankie.

105
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,722
Think about it.

106
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,393
You have a good night, ma'am.

107
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,901
This ain't the Holiday Inn, pal.

108
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,362
I'll move it. I'm movin'.

109
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,748
<i>He's movin' and a shakin'.</i>

110
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,210
<i>Benjamin gets blocked by Calvino
with 30 seconds down.</i>

111
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,254
<i>An overhand right landed by the challenger</i>

112
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,756
<i>with a straight
left-left-right combination.</i>

113
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,177
<i>And Benjamin is lifting up the champion
and pushing him away!</i>

114
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,803
<i>There's 16 left to go in the round.</i>

115
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,598
<i>And now here comes Calvino.
He lands a right.</i>

116
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,808
<i>Couple of shots landed by the challenger.</i>

117
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,145
<i>Benjamin landing some lefts and rights.
Calvino hits high.</i>

118
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,272
<i>And a left on the challenger,
bringin' the thunder.</i>

119
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,566
<i>And a knee to the body by Cal...</i>

120
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,240
<i>...right hand, and then a knee
to the body by...</i>

121
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,425
Maybe not.

122
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,377
<i>WYBS 106.4
for the Florida Keys...</i>

123
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,380
<i>parts of Havana, Cuba,
and the vessels at sea...</i>

124
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,049
<i>and 102.8 in Key West.</i>

125
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,164
Did you see Fred on your way in?

126
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,666
What's that?

127
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,459
Fred, the tree on the bridge?

128
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,754
Not the main bridge,
but the old one beside it.

129
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,882
The historic Seven Mile Bridge?

130
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,552
He grows right in the middle of the road.

131
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,553
Did you see him?

132
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,931
I can't say that I did.

133
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,226
You know, that whole bridge is closed.
You can't get to it...

134
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,313
but big old tree just
kinda pops outta nowhere.

135
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,356
Well, that's Fred the tree.

136
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,317
And...

137
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,819
got a book on him, if you're interested.

138
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,905
It's full of local color and all.
It's great for tourists.

139
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,534
I'm Charlie, by the way.

140
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,124
Hey, Charlie.

141
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,878
You run this bookstore all on your own?

142
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,087
No.

143
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,381
I am one of the owners, though.

144
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,219
What brings you to Glass Key?

145
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,847
I'm here to work at a bar.

146
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,682
- Bartending?
- No.

147
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,310
What other job is there at a bar?

148
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,104
Well, the owner's havin' a little trouble,
I guess, and I'm...

149
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,856
just here to clean it up.

150
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,983
That kinda sounds
like the plot to a western.

151
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,235
Like...

152
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,447
"Local townsfolk send for a hero
to help clean up the rowdy saloon."

153
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,282
You know that crap?

154
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,159
Charlie, leave this poor man alone.

155
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:03,372
Yeah, I'm sorry. She gets excited
about sellin' books and trees...

156
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,290
and Fred and all that... Hi, I'm Stephen.

157
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,458
- Dalton.
- Mmm-hmm.

158
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,503
Oh, he's here
to work at the Road House.

159
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,759
- Uh... Really?
- See, the owner, uh, Frankie...

160
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,471
she told me it was a roadhouse,
but she never told me the name.

161
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,306
It's just the Road House.

162
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,141
Oh, so no name?

163
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,519
Ah, well, no, well, yeah.

164
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,063
Kinda. It's the Road House.

165
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,693
It's just up the highway,
past mile marker 77.

166
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,197
Well, thank you for the book but...

167
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,157
- I'm on a budget.
- No, no.

168
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,326
Keep it, please.

169
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,452
It's on us.

170
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,579
Thank you.

171
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,960
Welcome to Glass Key.

172
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,920
Thanks, Stephen.

173
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,516
But just like five more minutes
till they get here.

174
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,185
I can't wait!

175
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,354
-  You guys wanna go now?
-  Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

176
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,358
No! Every single time. Every...

177
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,319
-  He's bothering you?
-  Yeah, he wants free drinks again.

178
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,612
You're not
gettin' free shit, Reed.

179
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,405
You gotta fuckin' pay
like everybody else, man.

180
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,282
If you... Okay.
This is the last one, I swear.

181
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,408
- That's it.
-  I appreciate you.

182
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,409
-  Last one, though.
-  Last one.

183
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,578
You're not gettin' any more for free,
I swear to God.

184
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,499
- Swear to God, this bum.
-  17.

185
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,042
-  Okay.
-  Hiya.

186
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,628
I'll get a black coffee.

187
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,298
Oh, uh... Yeah, we don't have that. Sorry.

188
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,636
What're you drinkin'?

189
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,387
It's, uh, Cuban coffee.

190
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,391
Okay.

191
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,893
It's... very different.

192
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,187
- Yeah.
- Can I have one of those?

193
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,732
Sure. Okay.

194
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,490
Hey.

195
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,701
Hey.

196
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,912
I know who you are.

197
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,957
Elwood Dalton.

198
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,667
Big fan, man.

199
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,003
What you doin'?
Just keep it cool, man.

200
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,130
When am I not cool?

201
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,926
Hey, I'm a big fan.
You didn't know who he is.

202
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,302
Here you go.

203
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,470
Thank you, ma'am.

204
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,018
Yikes.

205
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:13,812
Yeah.

206
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,233
- I really like that.
-  Good.

207
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,902
Yeah.

208
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,660
Nice place you got here.

209
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,454
Peaceful.

Get the fuck...

00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,659

00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,620

Hey.

233
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,308
Cleanup! Aisle four.

234
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,812
Get the fuck outta here, bro.

235
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,856
Hey, asshole.
You've been playing long enough.

236
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,441
Give me a turn. Give me a turn.

237
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,612
Oh, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

238
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,030
- Just let go.
- Hey, get me a drink.

239
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,073
- Let go!
- I'm not holding you.

240
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,282
Hey, hey, hey, come on! Chill out.

241
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,617
Chill out! Chill out!

242
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,078
Oh, Billy.

243
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,579
You're that stupid?

244
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,957
- Stop.
- You didn't learn, did you?

245
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,083
We'll whoop your ass.

246
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,460
You didn't learn?
You want another black eye?

247
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,963
- I'll give you another one right here.
- No, I don't want another one.

248
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,589
- It's Billy, right?
- Yeah.

249
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,049
There's some thirsty customers
waitin' for you.

250
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,260
- I can handle these gents.
- Okay.

251
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,512
Who the fuck are you, Mr. Smiley?

252
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,347
- Mr. Smiley?
- Yeah.

253
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,725
You've had this idiot grin
since I walked in.

254
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,018
So, are you happy?

255
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,520
Are you stupid?

256
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,647
Or get punched in the face too many times?

257
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,316
Honestly, it's probably
the punching thing.

258
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,069
Can I talk to you guys outside
for a second?

259
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,530
Nah. I got some work to do.

260
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,327
Another one.

261
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,416
Those are your bikes out there, right?

262
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,334
Yeah. Mine's the red one on the right.

263
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,341
Oh!

264
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,635
- Wait, what the fuck?
- Wait up.

265
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,431
Hey, asshole!

266
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,724
Stop right there.

267
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,146
I just wanted to get you outside

268
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,399
so I could ask you
and your friends respectfully...

269
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,151
to leave the premises.

270
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,319
Oh, we'll leave.

271
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,112
After I fucking kill you.

272
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,572
Sure.

273
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,616
Uh, before we start...

274
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,242
do you have insurance?

275
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,285
What?

276
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,745
Like, you have medical insurance?

277
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,705
Your coverage good? Like, you have dental?

278
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,833
Oh, ha-ha! Yeah. I'm not the one
that's gonna fuckin' need it.

279
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,126
Okay.

280
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,544
Sure.

281
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,046
- Hey, Frankie?
- Yeah?

282
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,297
Is there a hospital nearby?

283
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,298
Literally, who gives a shit?

284
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,050
Shut the fuck up and fight, asshole!

285
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,384
Is there a hospital nearby?

286
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,094
- Is it like, too far? Is it close?
- What?

287
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,805
About, like, 25 minutes, I'd say.

288
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,556
Like, depending on the traffic,
what time of day and stuff.

289
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,808
Moe?

290
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,017
- Shut the fuck up!
- Right.

291
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,352
Hey, what's your name?

292
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,854
- Dell.
- Dell?

293
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,315
You don't have to do this, man.
I-- You don't--

294
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,275
You don't have to lose, you're gonna lose
in front of all your friends.

295
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,610
"In front of"?

296
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,405
Oh, they're not here to just watch.

297
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,783
Oh, well, that's hardly fair.

298
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,910
Life's not fair.

299
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,912
- I just slapped you. Are you all right?
- Shit. What?

300
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,831
- What?
- What the fuck?

301
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,919
Damn! Damn!

302
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,587
Fuck him up. Come on, do it again!

303
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,005
Fuck him up!

304
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,173
Oh, shit!

305
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,178
Let's call this a draw.

306
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,389
What the fuck's a draw?

307
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,890
It's kinda like a win, man.

308
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,642
- Like, I win?
- It's a tie, Dell.

309
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,269
Yeah, like, we win together, you know?

310
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,354
Fuck you!

311
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:10,358
Fuck, man.

312
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,403
I'm gonna kill you!

313
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,165
Holy fuck.

314
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,210
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

315
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,920
I think you broke my arm.

316
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,089
I definitely broke your arm.

317
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,425
But the good news is
the hospital's only 20 minutes away.

318
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,427
Okay. I said 25. Okay?

319
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,679
God, I don't think I can
ride like this. Fuck!

320
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,180
Hey, Frankie?

321
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,099
-  Yeah?
- You got a car I could borrow?

322
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,851
I do, yeah, but not for them.

323
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,603
Come on.
These guys need medical attention.

324
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,147
Oh, yeah? I don't give a shit.

325
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,440
I'm gonna sue you.

326
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:58,948
Bump.

327
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,411
Shit.

328
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:04,913
I think he's probably
got a concussion...

329
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,917
and then he's got knee damage,
possibly a dislocation.

330
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,169
And then the one, that one,
I think needs...

331
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,962
Thanks for the ride, man.

332
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,964
Is that one a friend of yours?

333
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,592
Uh, no, I just broke his arm.

334
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,064
Hey.

335
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:36,110
Before you go, I really wanted to say
thank you for all the new patients.

336
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,949
Um... you're welcome.

337
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,535
I just love when my ER's packed
full of irresponsible idiots.

338
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,414
That way, the normal people with
real emergencies have nowhere to go.

339
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,458
But that's not something
you'd care about...

340
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,877
being a rage-filled dickhead
who likes to hurt people for fun.

341
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,504
"Dickhead"?

342
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,673
Well, technically,
I hurt people for money.

343
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,468
And how is that better?

344
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,889
I guess it's not. I'm just clarifying.

345
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,976
You know I'm supposed to call the cops
on guys like you, right?

346
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,435
Well, you definitely should.

347
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,731
Only, I don't think they really care about
rage-filled dickheads around these parts.

348
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,069
You're bleeding.

349
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,614
Oh, shit.

350
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,117
Oh, uh, no, that's just... It's fine.

351
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,284
Let me see it.

352
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,000
All right.

353
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,634
So, you like to fight?

354
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,221
You ever win?

355
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,518
No one ever wins a fight.

356
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,855
Then, why do you do it?

357
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,113
It's not infected,
but I'll need to suture this.

358
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,990
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.

359
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,325
Why not?

360
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,494
It's my fault. I wanna pay for it.

361
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:10,496
Fine.

362
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,338
- Can I?

363
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,225
<i>Someone left their car
in the emergency area.</i>

364
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,227
<i>Please move it. License plate...</i>

365
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,562
Cephalexin.

366
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,105
Oh, no,
I don't need anything for the pain.

367
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,899
It's an antibiotic.

368
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,233
Do the full cycle.

369
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,572
Hey, doc, thank you.

370
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,782
Sorry for all the trouble.

371
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,743
Tell it to my staff. They're the ones
with all the extra work tonight.

372
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,876
Hey, what are you whittling?

373
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,586
A stick.

374
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,630
Yeah, but what's it gonna be?

375
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,882
A smaller stick.

376
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,179
Is that him?

377
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,931
You have a good night, ma'am.

378
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,641
Again, I'm sorry for the trouble.

379
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,142
Thanks.

380
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,020
Yeah, that's him.

381
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,147
That's the guy.

382
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,860
He threw in little bits of everything.
What? The Krav Maga...

383
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,488
judo, jujitsu, you know, like, the slap.

384
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,448
What's that? Subak? Right?

385
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,451
Hey, slugger.

386
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,747
Here it is. One week's salary.

387
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,582
In cash, as requested.

388
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,501
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

389
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:39,669
Thank you.

390
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:42,046
Got a beautiful spot here, Frankie.

391
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,965
You bet your ass it's beautiful.

392
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,299
I mean, look at this.

393
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,761
Imagine having a drink right there
with somebody special, you know?

394
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,514
Hell, you could even get married here.

395
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,682
Divorced, too.

396
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,559
Then you can come back
and drown your sorrows.

397
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,478
I mean, it's a whole
"circle of life" thing.

398
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,939
Oh. That's one hell of a sales pitch.

399
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,065
Yeah.

400
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,192
Look, I know the Glass Key
ain't what it once was.

401
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:05,736
But...

402
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,158
I think this place could be
something really special.

403
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,243
Can I ask you a question?

404
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,411
Sure.

405
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,542
Why is it called the Road House?

406
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:20,751
What do you mean?

407
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,503
Isn't roadhouse one word?

408
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,338
Yeah, that's the joke.

409
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,923
It's a roadhouse.

410
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,302
But it's called the Road House. Get it?

411
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,387
Still unresolved.

412
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,974
Well, I don't know.
My uncle had a unique sense of humor.

413
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,353
Hey, so, there's this cute hotel in town.

414
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,482
I mean, it's the only hotel in town
but luckily, it's cute.

415
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,862
Well, you know, I saw that there was
a houseboat for sale at the marina...

416
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,864
so I thought maybe
I'd go check that out, but...

417
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,407
That old tub?

418
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:52,867
It barely floats.

419
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:53,868
You know it?

420
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:54,994
Yeah, I know it.

421
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,746
It's mine. It came with the bar.

422
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,539
Listen, you are more
than welcome to stay there...

423
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,249
but I highly advise
you sleep with a snorkel.

424
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,292
- Okay.
- Also...

425
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,668
watch out for the crocodile.

426
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,295
- The what?
- I shit you not,

427
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,421
it killed Shantsie last year.

428
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:06,422
Who?

429
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,507
The dockmaster's Pomeranian.

430
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,594
Oh, um... and heads up...

431
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,846
My uncle named the boat, too.

432
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,369
You're the poor soul Frankie's
got bunkin' on this frying pan?

433
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,703
Uh, yeah, I am.

434
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,914
Yeah, well...

435
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,875
you best watch out for that damn croc.

436
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:12,029
<i>Welcome to the undisputed</i>

437
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,657
<i>UFC middleweight</i>

438
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:19,328
<i>championship of the world!</i>

439
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,082
<i>Introducing first, the challenger...</i>

440
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:29,088
<i>- Elwood Dalton!

441
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,215
Dalton. Dalton!

442
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,759
There's no doorbell.

443
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,512
Probably 'cause it's a boat.

444
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,849
I should put something on.

445
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,100
Don't worry about it.

446
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,476
I got brothers.

447
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,480
I figured you wouldn't
have a chance to get breakfast, so...

448
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:47,857
I brought some food.

449
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,776
Love what you've done with the place.

450
00:26:58,701 --> 00:26:59,952
Help you unpack?

451
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,831
Uh, no, I just have this suitcase.

452
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,208
Okay.

453
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:11,380
Let's see, we got tostadas.

454
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,090
Breakfast burrito.

455
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,635
And empanadas.

456
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,101
- Ah. Thank you, ma'am.
- Yeah.

457
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,980
Uh, look. So um...

458
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,816
We've been through a lot of you guys.

459
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,653
You know, there's Arthur.
And then, Bennett, and...

460
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,614
this guy, Chris, who, like, I thought...

461
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,324
might last a little while...

462
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,950
but he's ex-Marine, just, huge guy.

463
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,660
But, um, total idiot.

464
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,121
Lasted less than two days.

465
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,832
I was gonna leave after that...

466
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,168
but now you're here.

467
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,504
I'm hoping you're different.

468
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,297
Maybe it'll get better.

469
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,883
Thank you for the food.

470
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:03,849
Good morning, Dalton.

471
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:06,769
Morning.

472
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:12,817
Hey, Dalton.

473
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,320
How you doin'?

474
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,284
Hiya, Charlie.

475
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,619
Hey.

476
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,830
Um, what can I do for you, partner?

477
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,999
Kinda wondering if maybe you had
a computer around these parts I could use.

478
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,459
Mmm-hmm! Over there.

479
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,755
Not gonna lie, I was kinda worried
you came here to return <i>Fred the Tree.</i>

480
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:35,881
Why would I do that?

481
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,552
How else am I supposed to learn about
the Keys' famous six-toed cats?

482
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,553
Good point.

483
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:44,098
And I have some good news.

484
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,103
I found your life story.

485
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,147
I don't know if that's good news.

486
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,151
<i>Death at the Double X</i> by Martin Holly.

487
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,987
Paperback western from the 1950s.

488
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,114
- Oh, right. A western.
- Mmm-hmm.

489
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:03,367
"The intrepid Wade Waco
never met a scoundrel...

490
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,327
"he couldn't bring to justice.

491
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,370
"But then again...

492
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,789
"Wade had never
stepped foot in the Double X...

493
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,208
"a saloon, red-hot with rustlin',

494
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:15,212
"cheatin', robbin', and murder."

495
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,047
You're intrepid, right?

496
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,591
Honestly, I couldn't tell ya.

497
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,594
It's four zeros.

498
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,761
Okay.

499
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,142
Yeah. That work?

500
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,393
Yeah.

501
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,063
-  Bring those back!
-  Shut the fuck up!

502
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,065
God damn it! I'm sick of this!

503
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,400
Shut your ass up.

504
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,360
- Bring those back or pay for them!
- Get back in there!

505
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,280
Whatcha gonna do, huh?

506
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,157
Go back in there!

507
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,701
Big talk. What a fuckin' loser.

508
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,161
Hey!

509
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,914
Get out of here, all of you!

510
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,792
Why don't you go find your daddy?

511
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,960
Now!

512
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,003
Yeah, okay.

513
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,254
Go on.

514
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:58,964
Go!

515
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,760
Oh, shit.

516
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:06,680
All right. Let's see it.

517
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,057
Fuck you.

518
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,237
What're you doing with that bat?

519
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,449
I hate those a-holes.

520
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,580
Where's your dad?

521
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,165
He's just at his other job.

522
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,378
It's kinda hard to make
a living on selling books.

523
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,088
Yeah.

524
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,675
The bookstore was actually my mom's idea.

525
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:45,386
And where's she?

526
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,596
She died last year.

527
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,516
I'm sorry to hear that.

528
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:52,935
Shit happens.

529
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:56,522
Only here, it always happens
on a beautiful day.

530
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:09,868
Hey, you working tomorrow?

531
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,036
<i>All right.</i>

532
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,205
<i>Yeah, a little bit more on the monitor.</i>

533
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,623
-  Yeah, no, it sounds good.
-  Make it work?

534
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,791
Yeah, no, I got you.

535
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,835
Hey,
can you cover me next Thursday?

536
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,086
Thursday, that's...

537
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,505
Hey, there he is.

538
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,508
How was your first night at sea?

539
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,844
I think I liked it.

540
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,430
Yeah, but I did have some strange dreams.

541
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:30,973
Boat dreams.

542
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,641
It's the rockin' of the ocean.

543
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:36,020
It'll mess all your sleep patterns
and shit up, I swear to God.

544
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,187
- It's fun, right?
-  Yeah.

545
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,397
See you, Frankie.

546
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,691
Hey, Dalton.

547
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:41,859
Smell you later, Carl.

548
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,114
- Uh, Frankie?
- Yeah?

549
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,328
Was there, like,
a town meeting or something?

550
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,664
- How does everybody know my name?
- Yeah, uh...

551
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:59,793
that's just how it is around here, man.
I mean, it's a gossipy sort of island.

552
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:17,019
Mr. B. Sorry, we're late.

553
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:19,938
Yeah, not at all. Glad you're here.

554
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,275
Because if you're here, that means
you're not somewhere else fucking shit up.

555
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,736
You, let's finish this.
I got half a fucking shave.

556
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,201
Mr. B, maybe you should hold off
on that shave till we get to shore.

557
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,744
- It's pretty rough.
- Relax.

558
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,664
Captain assured me
it's gonna be smooth sailing, right?

559
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,165
- Smooth sailing?
- Yes, boss!

560
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,501
Smooth sailing.

561
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,419
Also, what the fuck do you care?

562
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,088
Right.

563
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,174
Anyway, I don't know what you heard.

564
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,802
What I heard is that you're all
a bunch of fucking pussies.

565
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:50,803
That's what I heard.

566
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,846
Scared of some bouncer asshole.
That's what I heard.

567
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,307
Actually, sir, it was Dell.

568
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:56,684
He wasn't sure how to handle it.

569
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:00,187
Okay, let me talk
to this genius, Dell, then.

570
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,563
You can't.

571
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,773
And why is that?

572
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,235
He's still in the hospital.

573
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,237
He's got a concussion.

574
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,863
Son of a bitch!

575
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,073
I'm sorry.

576
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,158
It's fine. It's fine. Okay. Okay.

577
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,494
Let's keep the wrist nice and loose, okay?

578
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,204
- Sounds good? Perfect.
- Okay.

579
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:18,414
You can go ahead.

580
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,626
Can someone just tell me or remind me

581
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:26,922
whose idea was it to hire
these dumb fucks in the first place?

582
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,008
- Yours, boss.
- Here's the fucking thing!

583
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,929
You're all supposed to have
this job done by now.

584
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,849
I still think we could scare 'em off.

585
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,184
Are you, I... What did I say?

586
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,770
I said keep it loose, okay? Hands loose.

587
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,523
I get it. It's a little bouncy,
but keep it nice and loose.

588
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,442
That's all you have to do, okay? Easy.

589
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,609
Okay?

590
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,993
You, tell me about this bouncer.

591
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,786
Oh, uh...

592
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,080
Yeah, uh, I don't know, man. He's um...

593
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,707
He's kinda strange, you know?

594
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:02,916
What do you mean, strange?

595
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,502
Yeah. I mean, you know, he's...

596
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,213
He acts all nice and shit,
like he's Mister Rogers or something.

597
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,383
But then, man, he hauls off, he hauls off.

598
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,260
He beats the living shit outta you.

599
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,928
So, really interesting guy overall.

600
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,805
That was a brilliant analysis.

601
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,599
Sam, throw these dum-dums overboard.

602
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:23,270
Well, maybe if you just told us
why you want to tear down the Road House?

603
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,938
Great idea!

604
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,983
Let me bring you in
on all my business dealings.

605
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,527
Get the fuck outta here.

606
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,863
Go to the house.
Enjoy your fucking selves.

607
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,156
I'll be in touch.

608
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,618
Well, maybe it's time
we get your old man involved.

609
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,290
Oh!

610
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,878
Captain! Let me talk to you for a second.

611
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,385
<i>Hey, everybody.
I know we're at a bar right now,</i>

612
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,221
<i>but do y'all mind
if I take y'all to church?</i>

613
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:03,268
<i>‚ô™ Praise the Lord for southern women
Hemi engines, crispy chicken ‚ô™</i>

614
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,813
- <i>‚ô™ Praise the Lord for East Atlanta ‚ô™</i>
- Yo.

615
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,606
Yo, what the fuck kinda music is this?

616
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,942
<i>‚ô™ Praise the Lord that I got everything ‚ô™</i>

617
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,443
Yo, play some fucking Stones or something.

618
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,987
Get off the fucking stage!

619
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,532
Yo! This ain't fuckin'
high school garage band!

620
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,116
Get off the fuckin' stage!

621
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,662
The fuck is wrong with you, bro?

622
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,622
Sit the fuck down, you drunk motherfucker.

623
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,541
The fuck you're gonna do about it?
Mind your fuckin' business!

624
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:26,875
<i>‚ô™ Praise the Lord ‚ô™</i>

625
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,043
This fuckin' music sucks!

626
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,462
That guy's got a knife under his shirt.
The one in red.

627
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:31,713
I ain't fuckin' scared of you, motherfucker.

628
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,090
- Sit the fuck down.
- Sit your ass down.

629
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,258
Do you wanna handle it?

630
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,425
No, just sit your ass down.

631
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,593
Me?

632
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,595
I ain't fuckin' scared of you.

633
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,888
- Back the fuck up.
- Get the fuck out.

634
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,140
Back the fuck up outta of my face, bitch!

635
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,186
When he takes it out,

636
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,564
you just take a big step back
and pop him in the face.

637
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,357
You can do it.

638
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,901
Okay. Okay.

639
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,070
<i>‚ô™ Hemi engines, crispy chicken ‚ô™</i>

640
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,572

00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,202
Hey! All right, hey!

642
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,537
- You're fucking out, man.

00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:05,247
You're fuckin' out, man.

644
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,165
Stay the fuck outta this!

645
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,543
What now, bitch? What's up?

646
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,379
<i>‚ô™ He rockin' with me ‚ô™</i>

00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,216
Motherfucker!

650
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,636
Ahh! Fuck!

651
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:23,515
Billy, chair.

652
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,058

<i>‚ô™ He rockin' with me ‚ô™</i>

654
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,815
You brought a concealed knife in here
and that is a no-no.

655
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,526
- Billy.
- Ow! Fuck, man! My arm!

656
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:35,944
You got him.

657
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,696
Chill. Chill, dude, chill.

658
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,032
You fucking chill.
Don't fucking ever do that again.

659

Get the fuck outta here, man.

662
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,248
Get the fuck outta here.

663
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,000
- Jesus, what the fuck, man?
- Get out.

664
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,418
- I will fuck you up!
- Oh, fuck!

665
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,087
You know, I think I'm getting
pretty good at this.

666
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,924
You're a natural.
Don't forget to lift with your knees.

667
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,300
Lift with my knees.

668
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,093
Pool table. Guy in green.

669
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,685
Hey, back up. Back the fuck up.

670
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:11,188
It's a good thing he can do that.

671
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,815
'Cause, you know,
he's a pretty crap bartender.

672
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,233
It's cool.

673
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:17,069
Everyone relax.

674
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,404
Don't fucking do that.

675
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,718
- Hey, you're Reef, right?
- Yeah.

676
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,179
You were quick to back Billy up
the other day.

677
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:47,140
Yeah, I mean, I don't like bullies, so...

678
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,937
Those scars on your knuckles there?

679
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,774
Old habit. Used to box some in college.

680
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,359
Still hit the bag?

681
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,362

00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,337
Back the fuck up, man! Hey!

701
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:00,756
Back away!

702
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:05,635
<i>‚ô™ But I feel all right
You know I feel all right ‚ô™</i>

703
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,305
<i>‚ô™ I feel all right ‚ô™</i>

704
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,724
<i>‚ô™ I feel all right ‚ô™</i>

705
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,267
<i>‚ô™ I feel all right ‚ô™</i>

706
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:13,477
Julius!

707
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,946
Hey, you was right.
That was mad therapeutic.

708
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,574
Yeah, but remember, lift with your knees.

709
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,242
- Always lift with your knees.
- Sure.

710
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,078
Hello?

711
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,081
Hey! One for the road.

712
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,084
Yeah, I think even the road
is drunk at this point.

713
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,502
- What?
- I'll call you a cab.

714
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,295
- No, no. Boo!
- Yeah.

715
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,630
Boo!

716
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,009
Hey! No.

717
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,928
- Fuck, no!
- Just one. One!

718
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,096
What?

719
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,224
Hey, there, again.

720
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,811
"Again"?

721
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,395
Uh... Nope.

722
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,439
We've, um, never met.

723
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,405
All right. Watch your step.

724
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,159
Pick these up in the morning, Jim.

725
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,341
Later, Dalton.

726
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,469
We'll be back.

727
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,648
<i>First fighter to the scale.</i>

728
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:45,944
<i>The challenger, Elwood Dalton!</i>

729
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,909
<i>Man, this guy makes me laugh,
'cause he's a fucking joke!</i>

730
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,246
-  You fuck!
- Just a little slap.

731
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,789
You're fucking dead.

732
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,791
- You're fucking dead.
<i>- Wow.</i>

733
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,856
Fucking boat dreams.

734
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,406
Ahh! Hey!

735
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:51,968
Thank you.

736
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,682
You're here.

737
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,310
I am. Best conch chowder
in the Keys, so I've read.

738
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:01,436
Conch.

739
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,438
Sorry, what?

740
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,731
It's conch, not con-ch.

741
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,776
Nice haircut, Ellie. Really suits you.

742
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:08,777
Oh, fuck you, Frank.

743
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:10,737
I should've let
that burst appendix kill you.

744
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,910
My hairdresser.

745
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:18,870
I cut my own hair now.

746
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,873
People seem a little aggressive
around here.

747
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,292
Look, I should warn you.

748
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,711
I grew up in Glass Key

749
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,839
and people have a certain way
of getting things done around here.

750
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,509
Loyalties, family ties run deep.

751
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,179
Even the cops aren't always
as helpful as they should be.

752
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:39,683
If you cause trouble to the wrong people,
you could get hurt or worse.

753
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,938
None of this is covered
in my <i>Fred the Tree</i> book.

754
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,609
You sure?

755
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,152
You read the whole thing?

756
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,238
You know that conchs produce pearls?

757
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,365
Yes.

758
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,909
And that they have ornate spiral--

759
00:42:57,993 --> 00:42:59,661
Shells. Yes, everyone knows that.

760
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:04,249
That one in every 15,000
produces a pink pearl.

761
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,001
Sounds romantic.

762
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:08,962
Unless you're a conch.

763
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:10,964
Because what actually happens

764
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,508
is the conch gets a bit of
grit inside its shell,

765
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,927
which causes extreme irritation.

766
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,470
"Extreme irritation"...

767
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:20,307
that leads to something beautiful.

768
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,851
How is that not romantic?

769
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:30,275
Enjoy your conch chowder.

770
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,988
I like your hair. Did a nice job.

771
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,490
Fuck Frank.

772
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,300
<i>‚ô™ Yo, well, life is too short
So love the one you got ‚ô™</i>

773

00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,680

784
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,167
That's my uncle.

785
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,380
Just kidding. That's my uncle.

786
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:37,634
Funny one, huh?

787
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,386
Yeah. I mean, I didn't get the dude.

788
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,139
I don't know. But now that I'm older,

789
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,100
I think I'm startin'
to appreciate him more.

790
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,560
I mean, he was a tough bastard.

791
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,437
You know?

792
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:51,689
He had to be to do what he did.

793
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,234
Build this place...

794
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:56,319
in the '60s in the South?

795
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,115
That dude didn't fuck around.

796
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,536
I wanna be worthy of that.

797
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,712
Hey, want a ride?

798
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,922
No. You have a good night, Laura.

799
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,298
- I'm gonna walk.
- Okay.

800
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,625
Damn it, Dell!

801
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,378
-  Shut up. Just shut up!
-  My fucking truck!

802
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,213
Come on,
get the fuck off this truck!

803
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,591
It sucks! I can't drive this shit. Move!

804
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,634
No, no!

805
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,433
Forget about the truck. We got him!

806
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,193
You're really an asshole.

807
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,487
Yeah, I haven't
heard that one before.

808
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,197
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

809
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,127
You're a real pain in my ass.

810
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,295
Okay.

811
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,219
I was hoping tonight
would look more like an accident.

812
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,639
Drunk driver. Less questions that way.

813
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,641
- But...

814
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,101
I'mma just shoot you.

815
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,686
Can I ask you a question?

816
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:56,356
Why all the fuss?

817
00:46:58,358 --> 00:46:59,984
I mean, I'm just some guy.

818
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,320
Oh, hell, it ain't you.
It's the Road House!

819
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,119
Come on, man!

820
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,386
Fuck! Help.

821
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,972
Fuck!

822
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:33,768
So, you're gonna kill me now?

823
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,019
Why would I kill you?

824
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,776
Well, that was stupid.
I'm just gonna go right back up.

825
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,904
Oh, shit!

826
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,740
Help me! Fuck!

827
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:48,825
Hang on! Hang on.

828
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:52,537
Hang on, I got you! I got you. I got you!

829
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,622
- Fuck you!
- Hold on. Hold on.

830
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,265
Won't find the body.

831
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:14,475
Crocs hide their food.

832
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:15,977
I didn't know that.

833
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,981
That's why no one believed me
about Shantsie.

834
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,527
My dog.

835
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:28,948
Damn croc got him, too.

836
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,621
Hey. What'd that asshole
want with you anyways?

837
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,458
Hmm.

838
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,668
Must've got in the way of his business.

839
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,795
Oh, yeah? What's his business?

840
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:45,882
Hell, I don't know.

841
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:48,217
Drugs, probably.

842
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,971
I mean, that's all we got around here.

843
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,932
Why do you think they call it the Keys?

844
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,687
Deliveries by boat to the back
of the Road House. And...

845
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:03,024
- No, it's... You're... No.
- Can you... zoom?

846
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,567
No, you...

847
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:06,527
- I don't know how these things work.
- No. You wanna zoom in?

848
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,364
Okay, there. Zoomed.

849
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,823
But Glass Key's here.

850
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,367
Okay, just wait.

851
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,411
That's-- Right there is the back deck,
right? Of the Road House?

852
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,373
So, if you wanted to get
deliveries by boat...

853
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:19,916
Then you'd be plumb out of luck.

854
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,042
Why?

855
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:22,585
Because of the reefs.

856
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:25,421
You see, this area by the Road House,
it's just not deep enough.

857
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:26,798
Boats would run aground.

858
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,718
All right. So, you can't
get deliveries and...

859
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:34,097
it's close to the highway,
so there's no privacy.

860
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:40,520
This is kind of sounding more like
a mystery-western...

861
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,481
instead of a straight-up shooting-western.
Know what I mean?

862
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,233
Yeah, it kinda is.

863
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:58,830
Hey!

864
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:00,748
Is that a good bookstore?

865
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:02,417
Yeah, I like it.

866
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:05,503
Yeah. Sure looked like you and that girl
were having a grand time in there.

867
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:07,588
Hey.

868
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:08,589
Hey!

869
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,010
Get in the car.
Boss wants to have a word with you.

870
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,180
Who's your boss?

871
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,473
Brandt.

872
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,308
Brandt?

873
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,518
Yeah, Ben Brandt.

874
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,979
And he's waiting.
So, you're gonna get in the car or not?

875
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,817
- I don't think so.
- Hey, stop. Stop!

876
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,902
You did see that I have
a fucking gun, right?

877
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:33,364
Yeah. You made a pretty big point
of showin' it to me.

878
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,491
Okay, so get in the fucking car!

879
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,537
You don't understand
how this works, do you?

880
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,122
Yeah, I do.

881
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:42,999
But you have a gun,
tucked in your waistband.

882
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,959
So, it's really
not that intimidating, is it?

883
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,294
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

884
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,171
I mean, all I have to do is break
your index and your middle finger

885
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,006
and you wouldn't be able to hold that gun.

886
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,967
Technically, you'd be able to hold it
but you wouldn't be able to fire it.

887
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,927
So it's really not that big of a threat,
is it?

888
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,095
Fuck this.

889
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,558
Motherfucker!

890
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:01,726
Fuck you!

891
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:03,811
You cocksucker, motherfucker!

892
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:05,646
You broke my fucking finger!

893
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,818
You see what I mean? It's really painful.

894
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:13,529
You're not like a piano player
or anything, are you?

895
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:14,697
Fuck you.

896
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,532
You don't have a gun, too, do you?

897
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:18,993
I think I left it in the car.

898
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,745
Tell your boss, if he wants to talk to me,

899
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,997
I work at the Road House,
and I'm there every night.

900
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:23,998
- Damn it!
- Okay.

901
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:26,959
And your friend
is gonna need a doctor now.

902
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:30,838
But the good news is, there is a hospital.
It's only 25 minutes away.

903
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,263
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Frankie.

904
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,895
Holy shit. You scared the shit out of me.

905
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:47,688
That was kind of my intention.

906
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,483
I heard about Dell.

907
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:52,527
Are you okay?

908
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:56,197
I-- Yeah, I'm fine.

909
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:58,491
Listen, Dell was a piece of shit.

910
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,744
Okay? He and his friends
terrorized us for months.

911
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,121
And I know we shouldn't
be happy that he's dead

912
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,958
and the fact that I am happy
is a huge problem.

913
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,668
And it's something I'm gonna work on.

914
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:09,836
But...

915
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,172
I don't know.

916
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:19,136
I just don't get why he was
so focused on the Road House.

917
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:20,429
What do you mean?

918
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:24,058
I mean, you just said he terrorized
this place for months.

919
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:29,647
Shit, man. I don't know.

920
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,024
I mean, some of these guys,
they get real territorial.

921
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,985
Who knows why these assholes
do what they do?

922
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,989
But if I were you,
I wouldn't read too much into it.

923
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,658
So, you think it's nothing?

924
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,578
Put it this way.
I hope you didn't lose any sleep over it.

925
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:47,790
Well, I did.

926
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:49,166
Uh, a little.

927
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:04,807
<i>What happened to your fingers?</i>

928
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,893
He broke them. The bouncer.

929
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,144
He broke your fingers?

930
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:09,729
Yeah, when he took my gun.

931
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:12,106
Okay.

932
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,941
That's great. Great work.

933
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,861
At least you didn't
get eaten by a crocodile.

934
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:20,031
You find that funny?

935
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,158
You find this fucking amusing?
I'm not amused.

936
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:24,076
Put that fucking down! It's expensive.

937
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:29,332
This fuckin' bouncer...

938
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,792
is standing in the way
of my fuckin' dreams.

939
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,669
He's fucking killin' me.

940
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,129
And you're here laughing

941
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,632
as everything I've been trying to build
is going down the drain.

942
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,516
<i>Hello.
This is a prepaid call from...</i>

943
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,727
<i>Say yes, shithead.</i>

944
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,688
<i>...an inmate at
Florida Correctional Institution.</i>

945
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,024
<i>This call is subject to
recording and monitoring.</i>

946
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:57,652
<i>To accept charges, say yes.</i>

947
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:10,998
Go get my phone.

948
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:27,556
-  My love!
-  Goodbye!

949
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,449
<i>Hello.
This is a prepaid call from</i>

950
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:47,034
<i>an inmate at Florida Correctional...</i>

951
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:49,036
- Yes.
-  <i>Knox? It's Gerald Brandt.</i>

952
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,621
<i>Where are you?</i>

953
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,665
Clothes shopping.

954
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,667
What the fuck do you care?

955
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,962
<i>I got a serious fucking problem
in Florida.</i>

956
00:54:58,462 --> 00:54:59,463
Hang on.

957
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:05,845
Mmm!

958
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,097
- Uh-- Ohh!
- Mmm.

959
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,433
- Huh?

960
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,023
<i>Knox! Hello? Knox!</i>

961
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,482
- So, what do you need?
-  <i>Knox...</i>

962
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,443
<i>- my idiot son is fucking things up.</i>
- Yes?

963
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,694
- Yeah.
-  <i>I need your help.</i>

964
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:22,987
I'll leave right away.

965
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:31,037
Ahoy.

966
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,288
Nice boat.

967
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,749
Ex-boyfriend's.

968
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:38,044
But I know where he hides the spare key.

969
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,922
I'm kidding. He lets me use it.

970
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,507
He's a cop.

971
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:44,842
Feeling brave?

972
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,233
Where are we going?

973
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:15,956
We're here.

974
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:19,960
Uh...

975
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,672
In the middle of the ocean?

976
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,635
Uh, you need any, uh...

977
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:32,890
Come on.

978
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:35,518
Wait, why are...

979
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,604
Come on, grab the cooler.

980
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,317
All right.

981
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,908
They're not gonna find that guy's body.

982
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,284
Crocs hide their food.

983
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,747
Do they teach that
in kindergarten around here?

984
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,499
They do.

985
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:11,053
This is why I warned you.

986
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,639
You obviously stepped on someone's toes.

987
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,559
Some guy named Brandt.

988
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:20,312
Who told you that?

989
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:23,774
Why?

990
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:25,693
Do you know him?

991
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,280
He comes from one of those
old Florida families.

992
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,031
They built most of Glass Key.

993
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:33,659
Ah.

994
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:37,371
So, where are you from?

995
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,751
Me?

996
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,214
Montana.

997
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:48,841
Hmm.

998
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,261
Where in Montana?

999
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,181
Missoula.

1000
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:00,769
Is it a nice place?

1001
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,479
Look, I think maybe we should head back.

1002
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:04,690
We just got here.

1003
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,567
Let's head back.

1004
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:09,695
I was just asking simple questions.

1005
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:14,283
I just didn't think this through.
I didn't realize this was a date.

1006
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,035
What's wrong with you?

1007
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,042
You're a nice person.

1008
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,503
You don't wanna know me.

1009
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,468
Don't tell me what I want.

1010
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:41,018
You think we don't have
the Internet out here?

1011
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,270
I know what happened.

1012
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,776
And you know this is a date.

1013
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,740
Uh...

1014
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,992
Who put those fuckin' bikes in me way?

1015
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,368
Who the fuck are you?

1016
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:42,496
Shh!

1017
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,541
Thank you, God.

1018
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,003
Sandwiches.

1019
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,421
I'm fucking famished.

1020
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:52,965
Jesus. He knocked
all the fuckin' bikes over.

1021
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,760
Now you got a big-ass problem, bucko.

1022
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:57,845
No shit.

1023
00:59:58,262 --> 00:59:59,471
First off...

1024
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,307
I'm gonna need more than three sandwiches.

1025
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,641
I wasn't done talkin'.

1026
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:05,102
Actually, that's where you're wrong, lad.

1027
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:08,355
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1028
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:09,440
Pull up.

1029
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,152
Are you fucking kidding me?

1030
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:22,161
What the fuck are you doing?

1031
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:24,288
Hey, Mr. Brandt.
Just putting up a hammock.

1032
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,957
It's my father's house.
It's not a goddamn Airbnb.

1033
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,417
Right, but you told us to enjoy ourselves.

1034
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:29,585
- No, I didn't.
- You did. On the boat.

1035
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:31,712
And if I fucking did, I didn't mean it.

1036
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:33,130
Okay.

1037
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:34,673
Where are your idiot friends?

1038
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,467
They went to make some food.

1039
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,760
In case you're hungry.

1040
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,262
Clean this shit up! Who are these people?

1041
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,347
Get out of here!

1042
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:52,983
I'm sorry, who the fuck are you?

1043
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:54,276
Hey.

1044
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,153
I got a message for you.

1045
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,072
From your father.

1046
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,532
A message? My father? And what...

1047
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,159
What is this "message"?

1048
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:07,873
You're Ben, right? Jerry's son?

1049
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,795
This is where I'll store my stuff.

1050
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:16,090
And that master bedroom up there is mine.

1051
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:18,884
What are you talking about?

1052
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:22,721
Who are you?

1053
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:26,183
Your da says you've been
fucking things up.

1054
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:27,976
He asked me to lend a hand.

1055
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,396
How would my father know?

1056
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,439
He's in a prison, rotting in a cell.

1057
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:35,526
Don't be silly.
Your father has spies everywhere.

1058
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:39,071
Well, you can tell my father...

1059
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:40,823
I don't need your fuckin' help.

1060
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:43,200
- I have it all under control.
- No, you don't.

1061
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,160
Yes, I have people out there right now...

1062
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,162
cleaning up this final issue,
and that's all...

1063
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:48,539
Whatever you say.

1064
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,667
- So, where's this bouncer asshole?
- Okay.

1065
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:54,962
Can we just take a minute?

1066
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:59,133
You can't go and shoot this guy
in the middle of town fucking square.

1067
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,717
You understand that, right?

1068
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,637
This is a delicate situation.

1069
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:08,058
So, if we're gonna kill this guy...

1070
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:11,687
If? He's already dead.

1071
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,982
Once Knox is on the job, it's over, baby.

1072
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,608
It's just a matter of when.

1073
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,777
Yeah,
you're right. I'm sure.

1074
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:21,321
I'm sure you're amazing. Amazing.

1075
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:26,452
Um, I'm gonna try to do this
the easy way one more time.

1076
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,328
- Is that okay? Yeah. Thank you.
- You do your thing. You do your thing.

1077
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,497
- After that, you can set it all on fire.
- My man. My man.

1078
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,207
- Wonderful. Yeah.
- God bless, God bless.

1079
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,087
Who the fuck is...

1080
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:44,887
I'll be seeing you soon.

1081
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:47,931
I know where you live.

1082
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:53,854
Mr. Dalton.

1083
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:57,107
Yeah?

1084
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,026
We have a few questions
about the other night.

1085
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:02,279
Need you to come with us.

1086
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:08,911
Sure. Why not?

1087
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:38,690
Is that him?

1088
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,150
Elwood P. Dalton.

1089
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,290
Elwood?

1090
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,378
Most people call me Dalton, sir.

1091
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,756
Most people call me Big Dick.

1092
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,426
Uh...

1093
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,803
I'm not gonna do that.

1094
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:14,309
Your name reminds me of that
Johnny Cash song.

1095
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:15,477
Yeah? Which one?

1096
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,062
"A Boy Named Sue."

1097
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,565
Dad gave his son a girl's name...

1098
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,693
so he'd grow up tough.

1099
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,236
Are you tough, son?

1100
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,741
Your deputy says you had
some questions for me.

1101
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:32,119
Listen up, Elwood...

1102
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,372
I'm the sheriff of all of Monroe County.

1103
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:38,584
But Glass Key is special. Do you know why?

1104
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:42,129
I'm stumped, sir.

1105
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,716
My children were raised here.

1106
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:50,012
All the people that live here now
are like family, you understand?

1107
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:52,806
Yeah. So, you like Glass Key?

1108
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:57,311
I'd like you to leave here, my friend.

1109
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:00,439
You don't want to be my friend.

1110
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:04,610
Well, in that case...

1111
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,403
there are a few ways this can go.

1112
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,821
I can arrest you.

1113
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:10,115
For what?

1114
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:14,786
Doesn't matter. We'll lose the paperwork.
We'll find you someday.

1115
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:18,248
Likely, the very same day
you get shanked in the yard.

1116
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:22,002
That way, it will be ironic.

1117
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:23,712
It will make a good song.

1118
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:26,465
Elwood doesn't really
rhyme with much, but...

1119
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:28,258
I mean, if it's a catchy tune.

1120
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:35,349
Get him out of the car!

1121
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:40,812
Get out of the fucking car!

1122
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:42,856
- All right. All right. All right.
- Get out!

1123
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:00,791
You have a death wish, son?

1124
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:13,887
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1125
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,144
Come on, Dalton.

1126
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:26,149
He's my father.

1127
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,528
My mom died and I moved away
from the Keys...

1128
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:32,072
changed my name, took her maiden name.

1129
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,283
I don't know why I ever came back.

1130
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:37,911
The man you talked about, Ben Brandt...

1131
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,622
His father is Gerald Brandt.

1132
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,375
My dad used to work for him.

1133
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:47,671
He put a lot of money into Glass Key.

1134
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,590
Owned a fleet of charter boats
that ran tours.

1135
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:55,262
And drugs.

1136
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:59,099
Until he was gone.

1137
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,309
He's in prison now.

1138
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,693
And I guess, now my father works
for his fucking son.

1139
01:07:13,572 --> 01:07:15,115
You have to leave Glass Key.

1140
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,497
It's kinda sad, you know.

1141
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:24,958
I bet this was a nice town once.

1142
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,294
Nice towns are overrated.

1143
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:30,172
And how much damage
are we supposed to do here?

1144
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,175
Enough to make sure he gets the message.

1145
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,565
Charlie, out the back. Quick!

1146
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:53,779
Out the back!

1147
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:11,087
<i>‚ô™ I'm gonna go downtown
Gonna find me a bar ‚ô™</i>

1148
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:14,257
<i>‚ô™ Drink and drink till
the sun comes up tomorrow ‚ô™</i>

1149
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:17,552
<i>‚ô™ Oh, baby ‚ô™</i>

1150
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:22,265
<i>‚ô™ I'm gonna spend my money
On jukebox songs ‚ô™</i>

1151
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:26,186
<i>‚ô™ I'm gonna dance the night away, baby ‚ô™</i>

1152
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:29,523
<i>‚ô™ Baby ‚ô™</i>

1153
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,860
<i>‚ô™ You got me singin' whoo whoo whoo ‚ô™</i>

1154
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:37,405
<i>‚ô™ I don't know what I'm gonna do, baby ‚ô™</i>

1155
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:39,783
<i>‚ô™ My baby ‚ô™</i>

1156
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,830
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey.

1157
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,206
Ellie called twice.

1158
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:48,250
Said I needed to text her
if you showed up.

1159
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:50,877
Also, you're late, which...

1160
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:52,420
is a first.

1161
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:53,797
Had a little mix-up...

1162
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,216
with the sheriff.

1163
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,552
A mix-up?

1164
01:08:58,718 --> 01:08:59,886
What are we talkin' about?

1165
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:00,887
Yeah, what are we talking about?

1166
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,932
I'm curious, actually, to hear
what you were gonna tell her.

1167
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,934
Hey, Laura.

1168
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:09,229
Can I have a vodka neat, please?

1169
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:10,397
Yeah.

1170
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:15,944
I'm Ben Brandt.

1171
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:21,408
You...

1172
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:23,618
you must be Dalton.

1173
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,083
- Let me guess. It's your turn now.
- My turn?

1174
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,711
You know, to threaten me.
Tell me to get out of town.

1175
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,921
Like your buddy, Big Dick.

1176
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,633
No. No, I get the impression
that you can't be threatened.

1177
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,427
I wish you could be, but...

1178
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,804
I'd even bribe you,
if I thought money would work.

1179
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:44,389
Really? How much we talking?

1180
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,269
You're funny. You're funny.

1181
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:55,942
See, I can't help but wonder
what an outsider like you...

1182
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,320
thinks you're doing here.

1183
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:00,238
I don't know, Ben.

1184
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,991
What are any of us doing here anyway?

1185
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,160
Well, I belong here, you know.

1186
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:08,538
I helped build this town.
My father helped it grow.

1187
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,665
You know, created schools...

1188
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,793
repaired parks, paved streets...

1189
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,296
That was before he went to prison,
I'm assuming.

1190
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,885
It is a complicated story.

1191
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:24,054
But I'm not here to talk
about my family's history.

1192
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,181
I actually have a question.

1193
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:31,394
They keep taking this off YouTube,
but I tracked it down.

1194
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:34,189
You know, anyhow,
it is the fucking Internet.

1195
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,442
And I keep watching it
over and over again.

1196
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:40,028
And there's just one thing I don't get.

1197
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:42,739
Here you are, fighting this guy.

1198
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,283
He's your friend, right?

1199
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,202
That's what I heard,
that he was your friend.

1200
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,995
And then this happens, right here.

1201
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:52,499
Yeah, he's done.

1202
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,001
Everybody can see. Thank you.

1203
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:56,753
Right here.

1204
01:10:58,463 --> 01:10:59,881
Bam!

1205
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:01,841
See that last hit? That's the one...

1206
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,052
In my opinion, that's the one...

1207
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:05,804
that did it.

1208
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:10,308
That was definitely the one that did it.

1209
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:15,605
It was.

1210
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,318
So, I guess my question is...

1211
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:23,863
Why?

1212
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:28,910
Right? It can't be just
some competitive thing, you...

1213
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:31,413
you've won the fight.

1214
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:34,416
You can back off now.

1215
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,878
But you... you don't.

1216
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,216
You just keep...

1217
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,679
punching and punching and punching.

1218
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:50,849
So, why?

1219
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:53,685
Why don't you just stop?

1220
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:02,944
<i>‚ô™ I'm gonna go out dancing every night ‚ô™</i>

1221
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:07,407
<i>‚ô™ I'm gonna see all the city lights ‚ô™</i>

1222
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:12,746
<i>‚ô™ I'm gonna do everything
With silver and gold ‚ô™</i>

<i>‚ô™ I've got to hurry up

1224
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:17,709
You have a good night.

1225
01:12:17,876 --> 01:12:22,672
<i>‚ô™ I'm gonna take a trip
All around the world ‚ô™</i>

1226

1227
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:32,140
<i>‚ô™ I'm gonna do everything
With silver and gold ‚ô™</i>

1228
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:37,312
<i>‚ô™ I've got to hurry up
Before I grow too old ‚ô™</i>

1229
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:42,650
Make it hurt as much as possible.

1230
01:12:42,901 --> 01:12:44,360
You can burn the place down.

1231
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,112
Hey, nice suit.

1232
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,739
You look like a shitty pimp on Easter.

1233
01:12:47,906 --> 01:12:49,240
Then again, you always had bad taste.

1234
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:53,161
Thank you. It's Cleopini, Frankie.
I went to Italy to get it fucking fitted.

1235
01:12:53,328 --> 01:12:55,330
It's a long way to go
to still look like dog shit.

1236
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:57,248
- God.
- What are you doin' at my place?

1237
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,416
None of your goddamn business.

1238
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,043
What are you doin' at my place?

1239
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,920
Anything I fucking want.

1240
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:03,213
- That's the truth.
- Oh, really?

1241
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,176
All right, lads. Let's go.

1242
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:10,762
- Get out of my goddamn window!
- Fuck you!

1243
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,722
It's been a while
since I've been clubbin'.

1244
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:18,645
<i>‚ô™ Yeah, come on ‚ô™</i>

1245
01:13:25,944 --> 01:13:27,195

01:13:32,784 --> 01:13:34,410
<i>‚ô™ I love ya, I love ya ‚ô™</i>

1247
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:37,997
Just what I thought.

1248
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:39,541
This roadhouse is mine.

1249
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:44,629
<i>‚ô™ One shot for my get on boy ‚ô™</i>

1251
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:48,800
Hey, fellas.

1252
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,553
Looks like you're havin' a smashing night!

1253
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:58,143
<i>‚ô™ One lick for my get on boy ‚ô™</i>

1255
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:04,774
<i>‚ô™ Yeah, two lick for my get on boy ‚ô™</i>

1256
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,109
Hey, beautiful.

1257
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:08,069
- I'm Knox.
- Howdy.

1258
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:09,612
Let's dance.

1259
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,739
Hey! That's my fucking girl, bro.
What are you doin'?

1260
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:14,868
Fuck, man!

1261
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,078
I love this song, baby. Don't you?

1262
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:18,705
I guess.

1263
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:21,040
<i>‚ô™ When you turn on your radio dial ‚ô™</i>

1265
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:28,882

<i>‚ô™ What's up with pork chop ‚ô™</i>

1268
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:36,264
I hate this song!

1269
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:43,897
- Hello, band.
<i>- Back up.</i>

1270
01:14:45,023 --> 01:14:47,025
Hey, calm the fuck down!

1271
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:49,694
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1272
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:50,945
Man, why don't we
just take it outside...

1273
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,405
Fuck!

1274
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,489
Hey, hey, don't do it!

1275
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:20,350
Bar fight!

1276
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,560
Bar fight!

Oh, my God!

01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:39,369
Motherfucker!

1282
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,925
Dalton!

1283
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,262
Dalton!

1284
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:01,432
Dalton!

1285
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:06,604
Dalton!

1286
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:07,772
All right.

1287
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,025
Oh, hey, man. Good to see you.

1288
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:14,779
Dalton!

1289
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:21,202
Dalton!

1290
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:22,954
What?

1291
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:26,457
It's about fuckin' time.

1292
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:28,710
That's what!

1293
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:32,463
You know, I got sent here special.

1294
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:33,798
Just for you.

1295
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,176
But you brought all your friends with you?

1296
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:40,013
I thought you might miss
havin' an audience.

1297
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:42,390
I was trying to be thoughtful.

1298
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,143
Like on pay-per-view.

1299
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,061
25 quid.

1300
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:48,646
Watch me pulp your face!

1301
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,817
Well, I guess I'm gonna lose, then.

1302
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,028
Oh!

1303
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,405
Don't be like that.

1304
01:16:57,572 --> 01:17:00,575
Here. I've got a tip for ya.

1305
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:02,577
Don't let no one get this close.

1306
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,502
There he is.

1307
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:15,256
The world's most
notorious fighter, Dalton.

1308
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,050
Put'er there.

1309
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:01,511
I got it, I got it, I got it!

1310
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:02,488
There's something wrong with you.

1311
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:07,118
Me, too.

1312
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:14,125
Dex, this is serious!
Are you a cop or what? We need help!

1313
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:17,336
I sent two cars already, El.
It's the best I could do.

1314
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:26,262
Dalton. Dalton.

1315
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:27,930
Hey! Are you okay?

1316
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,894
Ellie! Billy's really hurt.

1317
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,061
Ellie!

1318
01:19:36,314 --> 01:19:37,648
- Come on, it's okay. Sit down.
- Fuck!

1319
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,108
He fucked him up really bad.

1320
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,943
- I'm here. What happened?
- Hit him with the golf club.

1321
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,695
That Irish fuck broke my back.

1322
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,405
Fuck.

1323
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:29,784
Hey. What, are you leaving?

1324
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,828
You're a funny one, Frankie.

1325
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:35,248
Okay. I mean, yeah...

1326
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,458
I know I wasn't totally
honest with you, all right?

1327
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,252
Brandt wants to take
the Road House away from me.

1328
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:43,172
You see that? All up and down the highway?

1329
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,465
Brandt owns all of that.

1330
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:47,009
And he wants to level it and...

1331
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,554
build some bullshit resort
for a bunch of rich assholes.

1332
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,557
And he needs the Road House to do it.
But I'm not gonna let that happen.

1333
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,642
I'm the last holdout, man.

1334
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,102
You should keep holdin' out.

1335
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:59,730
Hey. Brandt's out of money.

1336
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,566
And he's borrowing from shady guys.

1337
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:03,484
And when he doesn't pay them back...

1338
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:05,069
they're gonna fucking end him.

1339
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:06,988
All right, well, fuck that guy.

1340
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:08,364
So, what? You're leaving now?

1341
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:10,700
Frankie, I told you from the jump...

1342
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,535
you should've hired that other guy.

1343
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:16,539
They scared you off?

1344
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,666
Are you really that afraid?

1345
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,209
Yes, I am afraid.

1346
01:21:21,586 --> 01:21:23,337
More than you could ever understand.

1347
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:37,310
Things didn't exactly go to plan, Mr. B.

1348
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:40,146
Knox didn't kill the bouncer.

1349
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:42,690
Mm-hmm.

1350
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:45,109
Most of our guys are pretty banged up.

1351
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:49,322
Also, the wrong cops showed
at the Road House, so...

1352
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:51,782
Big Dick can't help us there.

1353
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:58,289
What do you want me to do?

1354
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:03,461
I want you to get me
another bottle from the galley.

1355
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,128
Hey, it's not safe in there.

1356
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:49,548
Where's the little girl?
That little girl and her father.

1357
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,217
Ambulance took 'em to the hospital.

1358
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:52,510
Now get out of there!

1359
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:45,438
I didn't hear a car.

1360
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,022
Yeah, well, I walked.

1361
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:48,524
From the bookstore.

1362
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:50,818
So, you got our little message?

1363
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:52,069
I sure did.

1364
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:54,822
Was that your idea?

1365
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:56,782
Yeah, she's a cute girl.

1366
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:58,451
She's kinda stubborn.

1367
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,703
Bit like you.

1368
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:06,000
You know...

1369
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:08,794
the funny thing is...

1370
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,921
I was already leaving.

1371
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:13,132
We finally scared you off, huh?

1372
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:14,800
Uh, not exactly.

1373
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:17,928
Just as long as you're scared.

1374
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,727
I just broke the hyoid bone
in your throat.

1375
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:27,688
Probably also collapsed your trachea.

1376
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:29,982
Either way, you won't be
able to breathe anymore.

1377
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:39,241
You know, it's strange. Somebody else
asked me if I was afraid today.

1378
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:41,702
I am afraid.

1379
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:46,207
I'm afraid of what happens
when somebody pushes me too far.

1380
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,292
Somebody just like you.

1381
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:53,339
'Cause I know what happens next.

1382
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:01,931
Oh, fuck. Okay.

1383
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,852
Hey. Hey, man.

1384
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,479
Wow, he looks heavy.

1385
01:25:08,646 --> 01:25:10,147
Good for you. Um...

1386
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:12,608
Hey, man, I was just...
I was just leaving...

1387
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,568
you know, for good.

1388
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,403
Turns out these guys...

1389
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:19,448
not as nice as I thought
they were initially.

1390
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:21,492
I just like riding motorcycles, man...

1391
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:24,078
but it's really hard to do
in South Florida without a group.

1392
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:26,288
Hey, man.

1393
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,332
You're not gonna kill me
or anything, right?

1394
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:29,500
Where's Brandt?

1395
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:34,213
Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you, man.
They don't tell me much. You know.

1396
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:35,673
Kinda the last one
to find out about everything...

1397
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,591
which is kinda weird position to be in.

1398
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:41,428
But I overheard some of
Brandt's guys talking and...

1399
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:43,180
I guess there's a meeting at Harvest Key.

1400
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,474
Brandt's getting some of the money
that he needs for something.

1401
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:46,475
It's at 5:00 a.m.

1402
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:49,228
Which I think is early for a meeting.
Am I right?

1403
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,022
Okay.

1404
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:56,819
I'll see you.
Thank you for no more violence.

1405
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,363
Good luck with the guy.

1406
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:27,975
Let him go.

1407
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:29,768
- Fuck off!
- Stop!

1408
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:36,775
That's enough! Stop!

1409
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,081
All right, all right, we're good.

1410
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:34,249
You wanna count it?

1411
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:49,390
- Hey!

1412
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:13,998
Oh, hey, you're awake.

1413
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:18,544
My boat.

1414
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:22,172
Yeah. You're gonna be
short one sheriff's boat.

1415
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:23,674
Sorry.

1416
01:28:24,133 --> 01:28:26,427
- Jesus! Did you just kill him?

1417
01:28:27,261 --> 01:28:28,262
Oh, no.

1418
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,556
He's already dead. I killed him hours ago.

1419
01:28:30,723 --> 01:28:31,765
Is that my gun?

1420
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:33,434
Yep, sure is.

1421
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,436
Wait. You don't have to do this.

1422
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,855
Oh.

1423
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:39,106
I wish I didn't.

1424
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:42,484
But I'm angry.

1425
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:46,488
It takes a lot to get me angry,
but when I am...

1426
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:49,283
I just can't let go. I wish I could...

1427
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,910
but your boss and Brandt
really pissed me off.

1428
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:55,789
They'll know those bullets
didn't kill him.

1429
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:57,624
Meh.

1430
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,585
It'll just confuse 'em.

1431
01:29:01,462 --> 01:29:03,589
I'll tell 'em it was you.

1432
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,507
Oh, okay!

1433
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:08,635
You know what though?

1434
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,472
There's a real possibility
you won't remember any of this anyway.

1435
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,474
Wait, wait, what?

1436
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:17,227
When you've been fighting
as long as I have,

1437
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:18,979
you know the power of a concussion.

1438
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:20,731
- Wait.
- A real whack can really knock...

1439
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:22,691
the short-term memory out of ya.

1440
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:24,234
Something about how it takes a memory...

1441
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,236
a couple of minutes to get to
the long-term part of your brain.

1442
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:28,113
I don't know. Anyway, you and I have only
been talking for about a minute and half.

1443
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,406
I don't understand.

1444
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,116
What's that over there?

1445
01:29:32,493 --> 01:29:34,536
<i>Hello, this is Coast Guard
Chief Petty Officer Williams.</i>

1446
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:35,454
<i>How can I help you?</i>

1447
01:29:35,621 --> 01:29:37,414
Yes, hi. I just thought you should know
that there's a dead body...

1448
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:40,125
and a suspicious sheriff's deputy
stranded on Harvest Key.

1449
01:29:40,334 --> 01:29:41,168
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1450
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,712
Yeah, you'll need to get there quick
'cause I already called the local news.

1451
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,964
<i>Can I get a name and callback number
just in case we get...</i>

1452
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:53,639
Sheriff.

1453
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:03,524
I just wanna talk.

1454
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:06,360
Are you here to arrest me again?

1455
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:08,362
Dalton, listen. It's Ellie.

1456
01:30:08,529 --> 01:30:09,947
They have her.

1457
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:11,115
Brandt's got her.

1458
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:12,950
Wants his money. The money you took.

1459
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:15,661
I didn't take any money.

1460
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:17,412
My deputy told me.

1461
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:20,082
You were talking some shit
about short-term memory.

1462
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:21,208
Oh!

1463
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:23,669
Shit.

1464
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:25,129
Yeah, I did take it.

1465
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:26,922
You need to give it back to him.

1466
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:30,676
Right, you told him I took it?

1467
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:33,262
It doesn't matter. He blames me anyway.

1468
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:34,638
He thinks I'm lying.

1469
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:37,099
It was my deputy in charge
of the goddamn money.

1470
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:40,227
If my daughter means anything to you,
you'll help me get her back.

1471
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:44,314
Dalton, listen.

1472
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:48,026
He wants the money by noon,
or he says he'll kill her.

1473
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:49,278
I believe him.

1474
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:51,822
Please help me.

1475
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:01,790
Okay.

1476
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:03,709
Oh, thank God. Let's get the money...

1477
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:04,960
It's not here.

1478
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:08,797
How long will it take?

1479
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:10,966
I don't know. I hid it.
It's gonna take a while.

1480
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,385
Where should I meet you?

1481
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:15,012
I like polishing my boat.

1482
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:18,223
Nothing makes me happier
than to see it all shiny and...

1483
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:20,726
Oh, hold on, I'll call you back.
Shit. Hey!

1484
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:21,977
Fuck you doing, man?

1485
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,645
- That's my boat, buddy. Get off!
- Great, you're here.

1486
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:26,523
You must be the ex-boyfriend.
I'm just looking for the key.

1487
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,026
Ellie told me to come get the boat.

1488
01:31:29,193 --> 01:31:31,320
Here they are. Bingo!

1489
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:33,739
You're that bouncer asshole, aren't you?

1490
01:31:33,906 --> 01:31:36,408
Yes, I am that "bouncer asshole."

1491
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,827
You see this right here, pal?
I'm a cop, you idiot.

1492
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,454
Don't worry. I'll bring it right back.

1493
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:42,122
No. Hey, you're not goin' anywhere, man.

1494
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:44,249
Hey!

1495
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:47,002
You're in trouble. Back it up.

1496
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:50,172
It's fine. I'll be back
in a couple hours, all right?

1497
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:52,049
Nothing is fine about this.

1498
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:56,637
Okay. Okay. You got two hours.

1499
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:58,972
Bring that back without a scratch
on her, you got it?

1500
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,891
Not one scratch.

1501
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:03,852
Come on, it's water.
How am I gonna get a scratch on it?

1502
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:42,391
All right. Let's see what this is about.

1503
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:48,438
Where the fuck is everyone?

1504
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,054
Thank you, sir.

1505
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:23,557
Come here.

1506
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:25,142
Money's not on the boat,
if that's what you're looking for.

1507
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:26,268
Oh, yeah?

1508
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:28,687
Man, you were supposed to
bring the money with you.

1509
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:29,980
Brandt's gonna be disappointed.

1510
01:33:30,147 --> 01:33:31,940
That's okay.
I'll just tell him you took it.

1511
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:33,108
Oh, yeah?

1512
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:38,613
Let's go.

1513
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:41,950
Oh, this guy.

1514
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:54,671
Nice boat.

1515
01:34:00,052 --> 01:34:01,678
- Looks expensive.
- Yeah.

1516
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:04,056
It used to be my old man's.

1517
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:06,850
I got it when he went away.

1518
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:10,562
Along with all his obligations...

1519
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,564
all his debts.

1520
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:14,566
So, yeah.

1521
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,485
It's fuckin' expensive.

1522
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:18,528
Speaking of which,

1523
01:34:18,904 --> 01:34:20,322
where's my goddamn money?

1524
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,323
Oh, I gave it to him.

1525
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,283
- You fucker!
- Hey, calm down.

1526
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:25,202
Sam.

1527
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:29,164
Why do you keep wasting my time?

1528
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:32,250
Honestly, you were told
the girl's life depended on it.

1529
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,336
So, where's my fucking money?

1530
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:40,008
I don't see Ellie anywhere.

1531
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:42,302
And this guy looks
pretty comfortable for a guy

1532
01:34:42,469 --> 01:34:44,137
who just had his daughter kidnapped.

1533
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,349
There's no kidnapping, dumbass.

1534
01:34:47,933 --> 01:34:49,476
Ohh! A double-cross.

1535
01:34:49,643 --> 01:34:51,895
You actually believed that
Ben took my daughter?

1536
01:34:52,062 --> 01:34:54,022
We are partners, idiot.

1537
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:57,109
Yeah, about that. I did kinda take her.

1538
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:58,985
- What?
- Another double-cross.

1539
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:00,112
What the fuck, Ben?

1540
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:01,446
I wouldn't do that.

1541
01:35:01,947 --> 01:35:03,657
Big Dick, sit down.

1542
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:06,701
Sit the fuck down!

1543
01:35:07,536 --> 01:35:09,579
How was I supposed to know
I could trust you, huh?

1544
01:35:10,163 --> 01:35:11,915
Once I get my money, you can have her.

1545
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:13,208
Son of a bitch!

1546
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,626
Boys, do you want me to give you a second?

1547
01:35:14,793 --> 01:35:15,794
- Hey...
- Stop.

1548
01:35:16,086 --> 01:35:17,796
Just stop!

1549
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:22,717
I'm trying to build somethin'.

1550
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,098
You keep on pushin' me

1551
01:35:28,265 --> 01:35:30,350
and just pushin' me.

1552
01:35:30,517 --> 01:35:33,437
And I just... Fuck, it's funny.

1553
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:36,440
It's like... I'm just like, "Fuck!"

1554
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:38,066
- He's noisy.
- Yes.

1555
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:40,193
He is noisy. He is.

1556
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,828
Now I'm gonna have to have
Sam here hurt you.

1557
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:51,663
- Oh, no. Please.
- Oh, yes.

1558
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,664
- Please, no.
- Don't look at me like that.

1559
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:54,749
Now, if that doesn't work,
I'll have to get Ellie.

1560
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,918
And shit will get real crazy, real fast.

1561
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:58,628
- Hey, wait, goddammit. Wait!
- Stop. Sit down.

1562
01:36:03,133 --> 01:36:05,635
Oh, my God, this fucking psycho again.

1563
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:10,974
Do not let that maniac on the boat.

1564
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:15,270
I do know one guy who's gonna be pretty
pissed about this whole betrayal thing.

1565
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:16,771
And who is that?

1566
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,941
Oh, just some asshole cop.

1567
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:23,195
- What the hell is he doing?

1568
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,030
- Shit.

1569
01:36:25,614 --> 01:36:27,115
What the fuck is he doing?

1570
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:43,507
Motherfucker!

1571
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:49,221
Ellie? Ellie!

1572
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:55,352
Fire!

1573
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,645
Ellie!

1574
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:57,938
Abandon ship!

1575
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:02,567
Ellie!

1576
01:37:02,651 --> 01:37:03,652
Hey!

1577
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:13,036
Ellie!

1578
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,168
Ellie!

1579
01:37:21,962 --> 01:37:22,796
Ellie!

1580
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:27,300
Ellie.

1581
01:37:28,802 --> 01:37:30,095
Hey, dickhead!

1582
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:46,861
Get off the boat!

1583
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:52,576
- Hey, asshole!
- Watch out!

1584
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:54,202
You're gonna die!

1585
01:37:56,538 --> 01:37:59,249
Go, Ellie, go.
I'll be right behind you. Go.

1586
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:10,260
I'm gonna fucking...

1587
01:38:17,267 --> 01:38:18,143
Oh, fuck.

1588
01:38:20,604 --> 01:38:22,606
You got shit taste in boyfriends, El.

1589
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:25,358
- Don't fucking move!
- Fuck you!

1590
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:27,527
I'll just destroy
the fucking Road House myself.

1591
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:52,886
There ya are.

1592
01:38:53,053 --> 01:38:54,220
Let me help you.

1593
01:39:02,312 --> 01:39:04,022
Lookie here.

1594
01:39:04,481 --> 01:39:07,317
- Our own little octagon.
- What?

1595
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:08,860
Who taught you shapes?

1596
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,215
Your fucking boyfriend!

1597
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,095
Let's pick him up.

1598
01:39:53,405 --> 01:39:54,280
You motherfucker!

1599
01:40:00,829 --> 01:40:01,913
- Fuck!

1600
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:06,793
Jesus.

1601
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,794
Dalton.

1602
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:13,758
You trying to kill us?

1603
01:40:16,261 --> 01:40:17,303
No. Get off!

1604
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:21,766
- Ellie! You always...

1605
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:24,436
You're such an idiot!

1606
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,239
Dalton, come on!

1607
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:45,517
Wait here.

1608
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,521
Oh, God.

1609
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:51,898
Ow.

1610
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:30,603
Fucking fishing spear?

1611
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:31,771
I'm done! I'm done!

1612
01:42:36,985 --> 01:42:37,986
Let's stop.

1613
01:42:38,111 --> 01:42:39,529
Oh, come on.

1614
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:41,239
I'm done.

1615
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:44,951
Shit.

1616
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:50,582
You broke my fuckin' nose.

1617
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:54,669
Everything I fuckin' worked for...

1618
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,881
all gone because of a fucking bouncer!

1619
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:13,646
Shit.

1620
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:31,456
Looks like I fucked up your leg.

1621
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:32,624
You're a shit driver.

1622
01:43:32,957 --> 01:43:34,083
Wrong side of the road.

1623
01:44:51,703 --> 01:44:52,829
Be nice.

1624
01:45:13,558 --> 01:45:14,976
This piano is out of tune.

1625
01:45:15,143 --> 01:45:16,394
Sounds pretty good to me.

1626
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:49,635
You gonna kill me now?

1627
01:45:50,178 --> 01:45:52,096
I thought we had to be friends first.

1628
01:46:44,065 --> 01:46:45,066
Kill him!

1629
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:48,611
Fucking joke.

1630
01:46:52,115 --> 01:46:53,116
Do it!

1631
01:46:54,951 --> 01:46:56,828
Do your fucking job!

1632
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,752
What does it take to shut you up?

1633
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:32,882
I'm sorry.

1634
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:51,484
It's time for you to go, Dalton.

1635
01:48:51,901 --> 01:48:53,319
You were never here.

1636
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:55,154
I got you covered.

1637
01:49:03,079 --> 01:49:04,121
Go.

1638
01:49:06,666 --> 01:49:07,792
You have to go.

1639
01:49:46,038 --> 01:49:47,039
Okay.

1640
01:49:48,457 --> 01:49:49,667
It's not so bad.

1641
01:49:50,459 --> 01:49:51,669
Yeah, no, it's fixable.

1642
01:49:53,421 --> 01:49:54,839
- Definitely.
- Yep.

1643
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:56,382
It's fixable. This is...

1644
01:49:56,966 --> 01:49:58,050
-"Fixable"?
- Yep.

1645
01:49:58,217 --> 01:49:59,510
There's a truck in the bar.

1646
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:00,636
That is correct.

1647
01:50:00,803 --> 01:50:03,139
But as soon as this is clear and we...

1648
01:50:03,306 --> 01:50:04,265
Little elbow grease.

1649
01:50:04,432 --> 01:50:05,599
It's gonna be good as new.

1650
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:07,601
Watch out for the pufferfish, please.

1651
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:10,146
- Come on, move it.
- Hey.

1652
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:12,231
- Yeah?
- Are you guys open today?

1653
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:18,112
Yeah. We're always open.

1654
01:50:19,405 --> 01:50:20,406
Let's go.

1655
01:50:21,324 --> 01:50:22,533
Swing around.

1656
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:23,701
Let me get this.

1657
01:50:42,928 --> 01:50:43,929
Hey.

1658
01:50:47,475 --> 01:50:49,852
So, this is it? You're just gonna...

1659
01:50:50,019 --> 01:50:51,937
You're just gonna
ride off into the sunset?

1660
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:56,359
That's always how the story ends, right?

1661
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:01,906
No, not always.

1662
01:51:02,907 --> 01:51:05,284
Sometimes the hero stays and...

1663
01:51:05,451 --> 01:51:07,036
makes his own little homestead.

1664
01:51:07,203 --> 01:51:10,206
I don't think I'm the hero
in this particular story, Charlie.

1665
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:16,712
So, maybe you're not the hero.

1666
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:20,383
<i>I got news for you.</i>

1667
01:51:21,175 --> 01:51:22,718
You ain't the villain either.

1668
01:51:31,352 --> 01:51:32,353
Charlie!

1669
01:51:55,584 --> 01:51:57,086
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1670
01:51:57,253 --> 01:51:59,255
- Shut up, man.
- You better stay on your toes.

1671
01:51:59,422 --> 01:52:01,132
- Don't matter if he gone.
- Shut up.

1672
01:53:40,564 --> 01:53:41,607
Come on, you pussy!

1673
01:54:21,647 --> 01:54:22,690
Stop that man!
