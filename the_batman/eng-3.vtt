00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:25.866
Hey!

00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:55.562
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.569
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:04.196
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.615
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:02:06.698 --> 00:02:10.535
<i>And 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.120
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

00:02:12.204 --> 00:02:15.666
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.795
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

00:02:19.878 --> 00:02:21.630
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:24.466
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.069
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:30.264
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:33.141
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

00:02:33.225 --> 00:02:34.661
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:35.602
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:37.938
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:39.064
<i>Under my administration,</i>

00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:42.943
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:46.530
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

00:02:46.613 --> 00:02:48.907
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:49.991
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:51.386
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.428
<i>But listen...</i>

00:02:52.452 --> 00:02:53.930
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

00:02:53.954 --> 00:02:55.414
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

00:02:59.918 --> 00:03:00.919
Hey.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.090
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:11.972
Why is she still tied?

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.563
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:29.072
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:31.033
Just call me in the morning, okay?

00:03:34.244 --> 00:03:36.723
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:39.291
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

00:03:39.374 --> 00:03:42.044
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.833
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:19.432
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

00:05:22.602 --> 00:05:24.270
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

00:05:27.773 --> 00:05:31.235
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:34.238
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.241
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:39.994
<i>Watching.</i>

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:46.000
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.175
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

00:06:07.813 --> 00:06:09.791
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

00:06:09.815 --> 00:06:12.443
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

00:06:12.526 --> 00:06:14.028
<i>It's a big city.</i>

00:06:18.658 --> 00:06:20.368
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

00:06:30.962 --> 00:06:32.880
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

00:06:38.052 --> 00:06:39.804
Look at this guy, man.

00:06:45.142 --> 00:06:46.142
Boom!

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:47.311
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:06:51.065 --> 00:06:52.960
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

00:06:52.984 --> 00:06:54.584
Yo, let's see your hits.

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:56.612
That's you.

00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:21.012
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

00:07:22.722 --> 00:07:24.974
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.852
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

00:07:29.437 --> 00:07:30.980
<i>It's a warning.</i>

00:07:32.773 --> 00:07:33.774
<i>To them.</i>

00:07:43.492 --> 00:07:44.702
<i>Fear...</i>

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:49.832
<i>Is a tool.</i>

00:08:00.927 --> 00:08:04.096
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drop head!

00:08:15.942 --> 00:08:18.486
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

00:08:21.447 --> 00:08:22.448
Come on!

00:08:30.872 --> 00:08:32.791
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.720
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

00:08:54.521 --> 00:08:55.665
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

00:08:55.689 --> 00:08:57.148
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

00:08:58.108 --> 00:08:59.359
Help!

00:08:59.442 --> 00:09:00.652
Somebody help me!

00:09:01.444 --> 00:09:03.446
Help, help!

00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:11.722
Where you goin', huh?

00:09:16.334 --> 00:09:17.334
Come on.

00:09:17.377 --> 00:09:19.045
Come on, man. Break it.

00:09:21.214 --> 00:09:22.632
You can't move, huh?

00:09:23.008 --> 00:09:24.718
Now knock his ass out.

00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:26.511
Showtime. Showtime, man.

00:09:27.053 --> 00:09:28.138
Come on, man.

00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:29.472
Come on. Do it, man.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:06.426
You see this guy?

00:10:13.642 --> 00:10:15.268
The hell are you supposed to be?

00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:33.578
I'm vengeance.

00:10:34.704 --> 00:10:36.623
Holy shit. It's him.

00:11:02.315 --> 00:11:03.441
Hey, man. No, no, no!

00:11:45.191 --> 00:11:46.568
Please don't hurt me.

00:12:22.604 --> 00:12:24.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12:25.565 --> 00:12:26.983
Police action.

00:12:27.567 --> 00:12:29.236
He's with me, Officer.

00:12:31.488 --> 00:12:33.073
Are you kidding me, sir?

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.742
You're gonna let him in here?

00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:39.204
Martinez, let him through.

00:12:52.842 --> 00:12:54.594
Goddamn freak.

00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:11.569
What do we know?

00:13:22.413 --> 00:13:23.789
Detective?

00:13:23.872 --> 00:13:25.499
Sorry, Lieutenant.

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:30.880
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.800
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.597
All this blood is from his head?

00:13:40.055 --> 00:13:41.056
No.

00:13:45.394 --> 00:13:46.604
Excuse me.

00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:50.774
Most of it's from his hand.

00:13:56.238 --> 00:13:57.281
Thumb was severed.

00:13:58.908 --> 00:14:01.118
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

00:14:01.493 --> 00:14:03.412
He was alive when it was cut off.

00:14:04.705 --> 00:14:06.123
Ecchymosis...

00:14:07.374 --> 00:14:08.918
around the wound.

00:14:24.141 --> 00:14:25.851
Security detail downstairs

00:14:25.935 --> 00:14:28.145
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

00:14:29.647 --> 00:14:31.857
The mayor was up here alone.

00:14:34.276 --> 00:14:36.987
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

00:14:43.369 --> 00:14:45.162
You said there was a card.

00:14:45.246 --> 00:14:46.830
Yeah.

00:14:56.966 --> 00:15:00.010
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

00:15:01.303 --> 00:15:03.013
Haven't a clue?

00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:05.474
Let's play a game, just me and you.

00:15:06.517 --> 00:15:09.061
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

00:15:10.396 --> 00:15:12.481
There's a cipher too.

00:15:19.238 --> 00:15:21.115
Any of this mean anything to you?

00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:24.868
What's going on here?

00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:29.373
I asked him to come, Pete.

00:15:29.456 --> 00:15:31.125
This is a crime scene.

00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:33.544
It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!

00:15:33.627 --> 00:15:35.629
I got the press downstairs.

00:15:35.713 --> 00:15:38.465
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

00:15:38.549 --> 00:15:40.384
But this is way over the line.

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:45.139
Wait.

00:15:45.222 --> 00:15:46.992
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

00:15:47.016 --> 00:15:48.142
How do you know?

00:15:48.225 --> 00:15:51.228
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

00:15:51.312 --> 00:15:53.123
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

00:15:53.147 --> 00:15:54.833
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

00:15:54.857 --> 00:15:56.400
He lies still.

00:15:57.902 --> 00:15:58.903
Excuse me?

00:16:00.446 --> 00:16:01.530
The riddle.

00:16:02.114 --> 00:16:05.534
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

00:16:14.668 --> 00:16:16.170
Oh, Jesus.

00:16:19.423 --> 00:16:22.218
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:25.054
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

00:16:25.846 --> 00:16:27.473
Excuse me, Commissioner.

00:16:28.557 --> 00:16:30.226
They're ready for your statement.

00:16:34.271 --> 00:16:35.981
I want him outta here.

00:16:36.607 --> 00:16:37.691
Now!

00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:45.491
Come on.

00:16:58.295 --> 00:16:59.505
Yeah.

00:17:00.756 --> 00:17:02.174
The kid found him.

00:17:07.179 --> 00:17:10.182
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

00:17:26.615 --> 00:17:28.784
We really gotta go, man.

00:17:34.373 --> 00:17:38.085
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

00:17:38.544 --> 00:17:40.379
A wife lost a husband.

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:43.132
And I lost a friend.

00:17:44.216 --> 00:17:46.759
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

00:17:46.843 --> 00:17:49.929
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

00:17:50.388 --> 00:17:52.557
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

00:17:53.308 --> 00:17:56.728
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

00:17:56.811 --> 00:18:00.899
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

00:18:00.982 --> 00:18:02.233
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

00:18:02.317 --> 00:18:05.153
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:06.821
<i>but I don't know.</i>

00:18:12.744 --> 00:18:15.622
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:17.790
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:19.876
<i>And now this.</i>

00:18:22.045 --> 00:18:23.630
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:27.592
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

00:18:29.677 --> 00:18:31.971
<i>But I have to try.</i>

00:18:32.764 --> 00:18:34.015
<i>Push myself.</i>

00:19:20.103 --> 00:19:22.605
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

00:19:23.565 --> 00:19:25.483
<i>behind the mask.</i>

00:19:29.988 --> 00:19:32.282
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

00:19:34.075 --> 00:19:36.244
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

00:19:38.621 --> 00:19:40.206
<i>everything that happened.</i>

00:19:54.762 --> 00:19:56.407
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

00:19:56.431 --> 00:20:00.310
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:20:00.393 --> 00:20:03.229
<i>Was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

00:20:03.313 --> 00:20:05.064
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

00:20:05.148 --> 00:20:06.816
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.401
<i>still have not been released,</i>

00:20:08.484 --> 00:20:11.362
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

00:20:11.446 --> 00:20:14.699
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

00:20:14.824 --> 00:20:16.618
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

00:20:16.701 --> 00:20:19.245
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

00:20:19.329 --> 00:20:23.583
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

00:20:23.666 --> 00:20:25.418
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:27.462
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

00:20:27.545 --> 00:20:30.381
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

00:20:30.465 --> 00:20:34.302
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

00:20:34.385 --> 00:20:36.179
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

00:20:36.262 --> 00:20:38.932
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

00:20:39.015 --> 00:20:42.268
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

00:20:42.352 --> 00:20:46.314
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

00:20:46.397 --> 00:20:50.568
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

00:20:50.652 --> 00:20:52.070
I assume you heard about this.

00:20:53.947 --> 00:20:55.227
Yeah.

00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:03.539
Oh, I see.

00:21:04.374 --> 00:21:06.334
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:08.044
Dear God.

00:21:16.803 --> 00:21:18.846
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:29.148
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

00:21:32.318 --> 00:21:34.112
The killer left this for the Batman?

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.198
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

00:21:37.282 --> 00:21:38.283
Apparently.

00:21:38.575 --> 00:21:40.451
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

00:21:42.495 --> 00:21:43.830
Why is he writing to you?

00:21:43.913 --> 00:21:45.391
<i>It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!</i>

00:21:45.415 --> 00:21:46.457
I don't know yet.

00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.084
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:51.379
Have a shower.

00:21:52.839 --> 00:21:54.519
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

00:21:54.591 --> 00:21:55.508
are coming for breakfast.

00:21:55.592 --> 00:21:57.594
Here? Why?

00:21:57.677 --> 00:21:58.821
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

00:21:58.845 --> 00:21:59.965
I haven't got time for this.

00:22:00.013 --> 00:22:01.681
It's getting serious, Bruce.

00:22:01.764 --> 00:22:04.851
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

00:22:04.934 --> 00:22:06.519
I don't care about that.

00:22:07.437 --> 00:22:08.313
Any of that.

00:22:08.396 --> 00:22:10.036
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

00:22:12.275 --> 00:22:15.403
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

00:22:15.486 --> 00:22:17.655
If I can't change things here,

00:22:18.197 --> 00:22:20.116
if I can't have an effect,

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.827
then I don't care what happens to me.

00:22:22.911 --> 00:22:24.037
That's what I'm afraid of.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.746
Alfred, stop.

00:22:27.122 --> 00:22:28.582
You're not my father.

00:22:31.376 --> 00:22:32.794
I'm well aware.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.373
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

00:23:35.023 --> 00:23:36.608
Some fresh berries there.

00:23:43.782 --> 00:23:44.908
What are you doing?

00:23:45.284 --> 00:23:48.954
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:53.250
This is actually quite elusive.

00:23:56.253 --> 00:23:57.921
Where'd you get those O's?

00:23:59.464 --> 00:24:02.259
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

00:24:02.342 --> 00:24:04.761
It only gives us H, E, I, I, S, and T.

00:24:04.845 --> 00:24:08.891
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

00:24:08.974 --> 00:24:10.350
see where it leads.

00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:13.270
That's interesting.

00:24:14.521 --> 00:24:15.647
Mr. Pennyworth?

00:24:16.023 --> 00:24:17.024
Yes, Dory?

00:24:17.357 --> 00:24:18.817
The accountants are here.

00:24:18.901 --> 00:24:20.736
See them in, please, Dory.

00:24:23.655 --> 00:24:25.866
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

00:24:25.949 --> 00:24:27.534
What do you mean?

00:24:27.618 --> 00:24:29.453
What if this is the whole key?

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.915
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

00:24:32.998 --> 00:24:35.101
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:36.293
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

00:24:36.376 --> 00:24:38.503
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

00:24:38.587 --> 00:24:40.422
I don't see how that's gonna...

00:24:42.966 --> 00:24:43.967
Oh.

00:24:57.773 --> 00:24:59.441
Damn.

00:24:59.608 --> 00:25:01.860
Yeah, he's got a car.

00:25:02.778 --> 00:25:05.155
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

00:25:05.239 --> 00:25:06.907
Where to even start?

00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:09.826
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.030
You don't trust me?

00:25:11.912 --> 00:25:13.538
You mean like you trust me?

00:25:13.622 --> 00:25:16.500
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

00:25:18.502 --> 00:25:19.628
There.

00:25:42.734 --> 00:25:44.027
What are we looking for?

00:25:44.653 --> 00:25:46.196
A USB port.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.406
USB?

00:25:54.496 --> 00:25:55.664
What?

00:26:01.044 --> 00:26:03.297
"Thumb" drive.

00:26:04.089 --> 00:26:05.716
Jesus.

00:26:09.344 --> 00:26:10.846
It's encrypted.

00:26:14.266 --> 00:26:15.559
Try this.

00:26:22.566 --> 00:26:24.943
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

00:26:33.827 --> 00:26:36.413
Oh, well, well, well.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.082
So much for family values.

00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:40.417
Who is she?

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.085
No idea.

00:26:43.003 --> 00:26:45.839
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

00:26:46.173 --> 00:26:47.973
I know who he is.

00:26:48.133 --> 00:26:49.134
What was that?

00:26:50.886 --> 00:26:53.722
Shit, shit! The drive.

00:26:54.473 --> 00:26:56.808
It sent out the photos from my account.

00:26:56.892 --> 00:26:59.436
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:01.605
Jesus.

00:27:01.688 --> 00:27:04.066
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:05.609
"He lies still."

00:27:05.817 --> 00:27:06.859
About her?

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.695
Maybe.

00:27:09.862 --> 00:27:11.739
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

00:27:11.822 --> 00:27:15.243
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

00:27:15.326 --> 00:27:17.453
Never get in there without a warrant.

00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:20.873
Yeah.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.179
Know who I am?

00:27:36.514 --> 00:27:38.766
Yeah. I got an idea.

00:27:39.225 --> 00:27:40.643
I want to see the Penguin.

00:27:41.352 --> 00:27:43.604
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

00:27:48.985 --> 00:27:49.986
What's the problem?

00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:51.487
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:53.739
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

00:27:53.823 --> 00:27:55.449
That's what I tried to tell him.

00:27:55.533 --> 00:27:57.827
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.870
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

00:28:01.163 --> 00:28:02.248
Mine or yours?

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.590
Get him!

00:28:11.632 --> 00:28:12.860
I saw that whole thing.

00:28:12.884 --> 00:28:14.093
He's over there!

00:28:14.176 --> 00:28:15.511
What is your problem?

00:28:58.179 --> 00:29:00.348
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

00:29:10.942 --> 00:29:12.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:29:12.485 --> 00:29:14.612
Take it easy, sweetheart.

00:29:14.695 --> 00:29:16.489
You looking for me?

00:29:17.198 --> 00:29:19.116
I see you met the twins.

00:29:20.076 --> 00:29:23.371
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

00:29:24.247 --> 00:29:25.748
I guess we both are.

00:29:27.792 --> 00:29:29.210
How you doing?

00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:31.254
I'm Oz.

00:29:36.801 --> 00:29:38.052
Who is she?

00:29:41.097 --> 00:29:43.015
I really don't know, chief.

00:29:43.724 --> 00:29:45.935
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

00:29:46.018 --> 00:29:47.395
but I wasn't rolling with them.

00:30:00.825 --> 00:30:01.826
It's okay, baby.

00:30:02.368 --> 00:30:06.163
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

00:30:31.898 --> 00:30:33.107
Thank you, honey.

00:30:39.614 --> 00:30:41.449
Here you go, champ.

00:30:41.532 --> 00:30:45.077
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:46.954
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

00:30:47.455 --> 00:30:48.831
Is that the mayor?

00:30:48.915 --> 00:30:50.708
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

00:30:51.918 --> 00:30:53.211
Don't make me hurt you.

00:30:53.294 --> 00:30:57.465
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

00:30:57.548 --> 00:31:00.509
Yeah, I do. Do you?

00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:03.763
Look...

00:31:05.014 --> 00:31:07.808
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

00:31:08.643 --> 00:31:12.939
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.865
Tell you one thing.

00:31:25.034 --> 00:31:28.621
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

00:31:29.121 --> 00:31:31.624
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

00:31:34.877 --> 00:31:36.712
What? Too soon?

00:31:46.555 --> 00:31:48.932
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

00:31:58.233 --> 00:31:59.234
Taxi!

00:32:01.736 --> 00:32:02.737
Taxi!

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:22.799
Hey, it's me.

00:32:24.092 --> 00:32:25.427
Baby, what's wrong?

00:32:26.094 --> 00:32:28.096
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

00:32:30.557 --> 00:32:31.975
On the news?

00:32:32.642 --> 00:32:35.937
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:37.731
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

00:32:38.899 --> 00:32:42.527
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

00:32:43.236 --> 00:32:45.864
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

00:32:46.781 --> 00:32:48.221
Uh...

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.494
God damn it.

00:33:11.473 --> 00:33:13.534
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:15.435
<i>With a younger mystery woman.</i>

00:33:15.518 --> 00:33:18.355
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

00:33:51.805 --> 00:33:54.724
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

00:36:09.234 --> 00:36:10.674
You're pretty good at that.

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:44.310
Hey! Give me that.

00:36:47.938 --> 00:36:50.482
"Kosolov, Annika."

00:36:51.984 --> 00:36:54.069
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

00:36:54.153 --> 00:36:56.906
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

00:37:34.985 --> 00:37:37.613
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

00:37:37.696 --> 00:37:40.157
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

00:37:40.241 --> 00:37:41.676
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.452
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

00:37:43.535 --> 00:37:44.912
What does she know?

00:37:44.995 --> 00:37:47.182
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

00:37:47.206 --> 00:37:48.791
She did seem upset.

00:37:50.584 --> 00:37:52.086
Back at your place.

00:37:54.129 --> 00:37:55.631
Let's go talk to her.

00:38:21.824 --> 00:38:22.908
Anni!

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:25.286

Anni!

00:38:32.001 --> 00:38:33.252
Anni!

00:38:49.268 --> 00:38:52.104
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:55.733
Shit, they took my phone.

00:40:28.742 --> 00:40:30.661
The real club.

00:40:32.955 --> 00:40:34.707
It's a mob hangout.

00:40:35.165 --> 00:40:36.584

00:40:52.182 --> 00:40:53.392
Who?

00:40:53.976 --> 00:40:56.395
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.649
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

00:41:02.902 --> 00:41:04.445
You're gonna help me on this.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:06.571
For your friend.

00:41:17.165 --> 00:41:18.499
You got a lot of cats.

00:41:20.001 --> 00:41:21.920
I have a thing about strays.

00:41:26.049 --> 00:41:27.383
You're not safe here.

00:41:28.509 --> 00:41:29.677
I can take care of myself.

00:41:29.761 --> 00:41:32.555
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

00:41:32.639 --> 00:41:34.182
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

00:41:34.265 --> 00:41:37.518
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

00:41:37.602 --> 00:41:40.438
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

00:41:58.456 --> 00:42:01.626
He waited for him at the gym.

00:42:02.752 --> 00:42:04.796
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

00:42:04.879 --> 00:42:07.006
when no one else was around.

00:42:08.132 --> 00:42:09.551
There's a needle mark on his neck.

00:42:09.634 --> 00:42:11.594
Injected him with arsenic.

00:42:13.596 --> 00:42:14.931
Rat poison.

00:42:15.723 --> 00:42:17.308
Yeah.

00:42:17.475 --> 00:42:19.936
That seems to be his theme here.

00:42:20.478 --> 00:42:21.854
Look at this thing.

00:42:29.988 --> 00:42:31.739
It's a maze.

00:42:34.325 --> 00:42:37.620
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

00:42:40.373 --> 00:42:41.457
More symbols.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.545
It's another cipher.

00:42:45.628 --> 00:42:48.381
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

00:42:49.048 --> 00:42:51.634
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

00:42:51.718 --> 00:42:54.846
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

00:42:56.431 --> 00:42:57.765
I don't get it.

00:42:57.849 --> 00:43:00.226
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

00:43:01.144 --> 00:43:03.146
Looks like he got greedy.

00:43:03.229 --> 00:43:04.272
You kidding me?

00:43:04.355 --> 00:43:07.066
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:10.403
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

00:43:10.486 --> 00:43:12.697
Maybe he's not who you thought.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.284
You make it sound like he had it coming.

00:43:18.536 --> 00:43:19.996
He was a cop.

00:43:21.331 --> 00:43:22.624
Crossed a line.

00:43:53.863 --> 00:43:55.531
"I'm mad about you.

00:43:55.615 --> 00:43:59.285
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

00:44:06.417 --> 00:44:09.504
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

00:44:09.671 --> 00:44:13.258
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

00:44:13.341 --> 00:44:15.051
The hell is that?

00:44:15.802 --> 00:44:18.972
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

00:44:20.098 --> 00:44:21.599
I don't know.

00:44:22.475 --> 00:44:23.643
Lieutenant.

00:44:23.726 --> 00:44:25.144
They're coming back.

00:44:25.228 --> 00:44:26.628
We got to get out of here.

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:31.776
Come on.

00:44:36.864 --> 00:44:37.907
Ow!

00:44:39.367 --> 00:44:40.702
I don't know about these things.

00:44:40.785 --> 00:44:44.247
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

00:44:48.251 --> 00:44:50.837
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

00:44:52.714 --> 00:44:54.173
I'm just looking for Annika.

00:44:58.469 --> 00:45:00.096
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

00:45:01.222 --> 00:45:03.850
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

00:45:13.401 --> 00:45:14.611
Look at me.

00:45:24.245 --> 00:45:26.414
Looks good. Here.

00:46:09.581 --> 00:46:11.583
I got you. Can you hear me?

00:46:12.543 --> 00:46:13.544
Yeah.

00:46:22.219 --> 00:46:23.220
Hey, where you goin'?

00:46:23.845 --> 00:46:24.972
Hospitality.

00:46:25.722 --> 00:46:28.559
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

00:46:30.352 --> 00:46:31.853
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

00:46:38.527 --> 00:46:40.612
"Kenzie, William."

00:46:40.696 --> 00:46:42.155
He's an off-duty cop.

00:46:44.032 --> 00:46:46.010
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

00:46:46.034 --> 00:46:48.078
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

00:47:04.636 --> 00:47:07.764
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

00:47:07.848 --> 00:47:08.974
Great.

00:47:16.231 --> 00:47:18.585
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

00:47:18.609 --> 00:47:20.193
Feels good, doesn't it?

00:47:20.277 --> 00:47:22.487
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

00:47:28.535 --> 00:47:30.162
<i>Jesus, I hate drop heads.</i>

00:47:30.245 --> 00:47:31.288
Really?

00:47:31.371 --> 00:47:32.390
'Cause when I first saw you,

00:47:32.414 --> 00:47:33.683
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

00:47:33.707 --> 00:47:35.959
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

00:47:36.585 --> 00:47:38.337
Can we not do this right now?

00:47:40.255 --> 00:47:41.798
Wait. Who was that?

00:47:41.882 --> 00:47:43.050
Oh, I saw him.

00:47:43.133 --> 00:47:44.218
<i>Look back.</i>

00:47:44.301 --> 00:47:46.154
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

00:47:46.178 --> 00:47:47.512
I need to see his face.

00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:50.641
Jesus.

00:47:58.649 --> 00:47:59.816
That's the DA.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:00.943
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.694
And he's coming over. You happy?

00:48:02.778 --> 00:48:03.987
<i>Talk to him.</i>

00:48:07.115 --> 00:48:08.200
Hey. How you doing?

00:48:08.283 --> 00:48:09.368
Hi.

00:48:09.451 --> 00:48:10.451
I'm Gil.

00:48:11.495 --> 00:48:13.121
Hey, aren't you the DA?

00:48:13.205 --> 00:48:14.205
Yeah.

00:48:14.373 --> 00:48:16.542
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

00:48:16.625 --> 00:48:18.001
Is that right?

00:48:18.418 --> 00:48:20.629
I haven't seen you around here before.

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:23.674
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

00:48:23.757 --> 00:48:26.301
'cause people are all a little on edge.

00:48:26.385 --> 00:48:27.945
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.239
<i>Is that right?</i>

00:48:29.263 --> 00:48:30.472
<i>I like that.</i>

00:48:30.847 --> 00:48:31.890
Do you want to come over?

00:48:31.974 --> 00:48:33.100
Sure.

00:48:36.103 --> 00:48:37.437
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

00:48:37.521 --> 00:48:39.081
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

00:48:39.231 --> 00:48:41.108
<i>- Richie, Glen.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

00:48:42.568 --> 00:48:44.069
That's half the DA's office.

00:48:44.152 --> 00:48:45.380
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

00:48:45.404 --> 00:48:46.404
Hi.

00:48:46.446 --> 00:48:48.550
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

00:48:48.574 --> 00:48:50.450
Drowning our sorrows.

00:48:50.784 --> 00:48:52.077
<i>You want a drop?</i>

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.204
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

00:48:56.164 --> 00:48:57.833
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

00:48:57.916 --> 00:49:00.276
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

00:49:00.419 --> 00:49:01.419
He's wasted.

00:49:01.461 --> 00:49:02.504
No shit.

00:49:04.172 --> 00:49:05.292
<i>I like this girl.</i>

00:49:05.632 --> 00:49:07.217
Oh, hey, I like you too!

00:49:10.762 --> 00:49:14.099
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

00:49:14.182 --> 00:49:15.267
<i>He knows so much.</i>

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:16.703
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

00:49:16.727 --> 00:49:19.038
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

00:49:19.062 --> 00:49:19.980
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

00:49:20.063 --> 00:49:22.041
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

00:49:22.065 --> 00:49:24.026
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

00:49:26.028 --> 00:49:27.863
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

00:49:38.207 --> 00:49:39.416
<i>I mean...</i>

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:43.837
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

00:49:44.421 --> 00:49:46.840
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

00:49:46.924 --> 00:49:48.693
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

00:49:48.717 --> 00:49:50.302
He's talking about the Maroni case.

00:49:50.385 --> 00:49:53.680
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

00:49:54.264 --> 00:49:56.558
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

00:49:56.642 --> 00:49:58.560
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

00:49:58.644 --> 00:50:01.331
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

00:50:01.355 --> 00:50:02.606
What do you know about that?

00:50:04.233 --> 00:50:05.400
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

00:50:05.484 --> 00:50:06.484
<i>I want a drink.</i>

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:07.861
Keep him talking.

00:50:10.948 --> 00:50:12.032
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

00:50:12.115 --> 00:50:13.158
She knows Annika.

00:50:13.242 --> 00:50:14.660
No, stay on the DA.

00:50:14.743 --> 00:50:16.662
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:20.916
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

00:50:20.999 --> 00:50:22.101
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

00:50:22.125 --> 00:50:24.729
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

00:50:24.753 --> 00:50:26.004
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

00:50:26.088 --> 00:50:28.548
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

00:50:28.631 --> 00:50:31.551
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

00:50:31.634 --> 00:50:33.195
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

00:50:33.219 --> 00:50:34.303
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

00:50:39.058 --> 00:50:40.101
<i>Hey.</i>

00:50:40.685 --> 00:50:41.769
Hey.

00:50:42.937 --> 00:50:46.107
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.609
How you been?

00:50:50.945 --> 00:50:52.655
Yeah, I've been okay.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:55.366
<i>I was just...</i>

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:59.245
I was just headed back upstairs.

00:50:59.996 --> 00:51:00.997
Well...

00:51:02.081 --> 00:51:03.749
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

00:51:17.847 --> 00:51:20.224
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

00:51:20.308 --> 00:51:21.952
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

00:51:21.976 --> 00:51:23.769
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

00:51:23.853 --> 00:51:25.747
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

00:51:25.771 --> 00:51:26.856
Wait, what are you doing?

00:51:26.939 --> 00:51:29.358
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

00:51:33.946 --> 00:51:34.947
Taxi!

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:39.911
Hey!

00:51:41.621 --> 00:51:42.705
I lost you in there.

00:51:42.788 --> 00:51:43.873
Yeah, I gotta go.

00:51:44.749 --> 00:51:46.167
Oh, you need a ride?

00:51:46.876 --> 00:51:48.169
That's me right there.

00:51:54.258 --> 00:51:55.343
Taxi!

00:51:55.426 --> 00:51:56.552
I'm good.

00:51:58.262 --> 00:51:59.680
I hope, uh...

00:52:04.268 --> 00:52:05.686
I'll see you around.

00:53:32.356 --> 00:53:36.152
Just hold still.

00:54:34.502 --> 00:54:35.419
What do you know about

00:54:35.503 --> 00:54:37.797
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

00:54:40.883 --> 00:54:42.593
Yeah, sure, there was.

00:54:43.302 --> 00:54:45.137
That's the rat we're looking for.

00:54:46.055 --> 00:54:47.932
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

00:54:48.516 --> 00:54:51.519
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

00:54:51.602 --> 00:54:53.062
Where are you getting this?

00:54:53.145 --> 00:54:56.023
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

00:54:56.816 --> 00:54:58.276
Gil's very nervous.

00:54:59.235 --> 00:55:01.779
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

00:55:01.862 --> 00:55:03.739
I worked that case.

00:55:03.823 --> 00:55:05.783
Riddler's not after you.

00:55:05.866 --> 00:55:06.866
How do you know?

00:55:07.158 --> 00:55:08.577
You're not corrupt.

00:55:09.619 --> 00:55:11.162
Colson's dirty?

00:55:17.043 --> 00:55:18.545
Maybe I, uh...

00:55:19.212 --> 00:55:22.549
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

00:55:22.632 --> 00:55:25.927
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

00:55:26.678 --> 00:55:28.471
Who knows how many people it touches.

00:55:28.555 --> 00:55:31.766
Politicians. Police. The courts.

00:55:33.059 --> 00:55:34.769
It could tear the whole city apart.

00:55:35.186 --> 00:55:37.230
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

00:55:38.857 --> 00:55:40.609
And Riddler's the match.

00:55:41.484 --> 00:55:42.712
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

00:55:42.736 --> 00:55:44.088
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

00:55:44.112 --> 00:55:45.590
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:45.614 --> 00:55:47.174
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

00:55:48.158 --> 00:55:49.802
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:49.826 --> 00:55:51.596
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

00:55:52.621 --> 00:55:54.080
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

00:55:54.164 --> 00:55:55.266
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:56.976
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.895
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

00:55:58.919 --> 00:56:00.399
Pretty.

00:56:02.172 --> 00:56:03.548
She a new friend of yours?

00:56:08.136 --> 00:56:09.346
I'm not so sure.

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:11.681
Looks like you upset her.

00:56:12.849 --> 00:56:14.976
Shall I take this as a good sign?

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.061
What?

00:56:16.144 --> 00:56:17.062
Your attire.

00:56:17.145 --> 00:56:19.272
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

00:56:19.356 --> 00:56:21.358
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

00:56:21.441 --> 00:56:24.110
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

00:56:25.153 --> 00:56:26.738
Riddler might not be able to resist.

00:56:26.821 --> 00:56:28.281
Oh, that reminds me.

00:56:29.449 --> 00:56:33.411
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

00:56:33.954 --> 00:56:35.455
The one from the rat maze.

00:56:35.872 --> 00:56:38.959
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

00:56:39.292 --> 00:56:41.169
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

00:56:41.253 --> 00:56:44.506
"You are <i>El Rata A lad a."</i>

00:56:45.131 --> 00:56:46.550
<i>Rata A lad a?</i>

00:56:46.633 --> 00:56:47.842
"Rat with wings"?

00:56:47.926 --> 00:56:50.428
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

00:56:50.512 --> 00:56:51.763
Yeah.

00:56:53.223 --> 00:56:54.349
A stool pigeon.

00:56:54.599 --> 00:56:56.226
Where are your cufflinks?

00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:57.309
I couldn't find them.

00:56:58.728 --> 00:57:00.689
Well, you can't go out like that.

00:57:00.772 --> 00:57:02.566
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

00:57:06.736 --> 00:57:09.531
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

00:57:11.241 --> 00:57:13.451
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

00:57:14.452 --> 00:57:16.246
Your father gave them to me.

00:57:22.002 --> 00:57:25.130
No more lies! No more lies!

00:57:43.315 --> 00:57:46.276
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:00.582
Is that Bruce Wayne?

00:58:00.665 --> 00:58:03.293
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

00:58:12.385 --> 00:58:13.386
Hold it.

00:58:14.721 --> 00:58:15.972
You good, fellas?

00:58:16.556 --> 00:58:17.557
Good.

00:58:19.684 --> 00:58:20.769
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

00:58:38.578 --> 00:58:39.579
Sir?

00:58:59.266 --> 00:59:00.266
Hey!

00:59:00.308 --> 00:59:02.310
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:05.105
Hey, watch it, fellas.

00:59:05.564 --> 00:59:07.857
You got the prince of the city there.

00:59:10.694 --> 00:59:12.529
Some event, huh?

00:59:12.612 --> 00:59:15.574
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

00:59:15.657 --> 00:59:18.118
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

00:59:18.201 --> 00:59:19.887
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

00:59:19.911 --> 00:59:21.913
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:24.207
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

00:59:24.833 --> 00:59:26.293
Wow. Is that right?

00:59:26.376 --> 00:59:28.420
His father saved my life.

00:59:29.379 --> 00:59:32.591
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:37.304
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

00:59:37.596 --> 00:59:40.807
Operated right on the dining room table.

00:59:40.891 --> 00:59:46.146
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

00:59:47.563 --> 00:59:49.565
I remember your face.

00:59:51.567 --> 00:59:53.527
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

00:59:53.903 --> 00:59:56.030
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

00:59:57.364 --> 00:59:58.949
"Hippocratic oath."

01:00:01.493 --> 01:00:02.703
That's good.

01:00:03.245 --> 01:00:04.413
Excuse me.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Yes.

01:00:23.015 --> 01:00:24.159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:00:24.183 --> 01:00:25.827
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:28.229
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

01:00:28.312 --> 01:00:30.105
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

01:00:30.189 --> 01:00:31.629
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:33.168
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

01:00:33.192 --> 01:00:34.610
<i>consider a donation to</i>

01:00:34.693 --> 01:00:36.737
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.073
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

01:00:39.156 --> 01:00:40.366
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

01:00:40.741 --> 01:00:43.285
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:48.123
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

01:00:48.207 --> 01:00:51.418
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

01:00:52.419 --> 01:00:54.296
He got what he deserved.

01:00:56.215 --> 01:00:57.216
Know what I mean?

01:00:58.509 --> 01:01:00.636
Hey, don't I know you?

01:01:00.719 --> 01:01:01.804
Bruce Wayne.

01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:04.682
Why haven't you called me back?

01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:05.766
I'm sorry?

01:01:06.058 --> 01:01:08.394
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

01:01:08.477 --> 01:01:09.746
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:12.439
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

01:01:12.523 --> 01:01:13.857
Will you walk with me?

01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:20.364
Mr. Wayne.

01:01:20.447 --> 01:01:21.657
Mr. Wayne.

01:01:22.366 --> 01:01:25.452
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

01:01:26.036 --> 01:01:27.872
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

01:01:27.955 --> 01:01:30.374
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

01:01:30.457 --> 01:01:32.918
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

01:01:33.502 --> 01:01:34.795
Thank you.

01:01:35.671 --> 01:01:36.672
My God.

01:01:38.507 --> 01:01:41.010
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

01:01:41.093 --> 01:01:42.720
I want to continue this.

01:01:46.932 --> 01:01:47.932
Excuse me.

01:01:49.852 --> 01:01:51.729
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:01:53.939 --> 01:01:54.857
Thank you.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.700
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

01:01:58.027 --> 01:01:59.904
Gil Colson is missing.

01:01:59.987 --> 01:02:01.280
What?

01:02:01.363 --> 01:02:03.657
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:04.783
Christ, not again.

01:02:04.867 --> 01:02:06.952
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

01:02:09.246 --> 01:02:11.290
You got people looking for him, Jim?

01:02:11.957 --> 01:02:14.251
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

01:02:14.335 --> 01:02:15.252
What'd his wife say?

01:02:15.336 --> 01:02:16.736
She hadn't heard from him.

01:03:11.308 --> 01:03:12.428
Get out of the car!

01:03:12.977 --> 01:03:15.187
Get out of the car and show your hands!

01:03:16.605 --> 01:03:17.815
Get out!

01:03:28.325 --> 01:03:29.618
Get 'em up!

01:03:29.702 --> 01:03:31.453
Get out! Show 'em!

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:37.501
Christ, it's Colson.

01:03:37.585 --> 01:03:39.295
There's a bomb around his neck!

01:03:54.351 --> 01:03:55.895
Let's clear this place out now!

01:03:55.978 --> 01:03:58.018
We've got to get this place cleared out!

01:04:31.846 --> 01:04:34.599
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

01:04:37.602 --> 01:04:39.202
We don't know if he's in on it.

01:04:42.148 --> 01:04:43.483
What's he looking at?

01:05:02.252 --> 01:05:03.586
Holy shit.

01:05:04.629 --> 01:05:06.297
Are you kidding me?

01:05:06.381 --> 01:05:09.133
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

01:05:09.968 --> 01:05:12.428
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

01:05:28.194 --> 01:05:29.404
Please.

01:05:29.571 --> 01:05:32.323
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:35.010
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

01:05:35.034 --> 01:05:36.035
I'm so sorry.

01:05:36.536 --> 01:05:38.204
Looks like a combination lock.

01:05:38.288 --> 01:05:39.747
Can't we just cut it off?

01:05:40.498 --> 01:05:42.166
Not if you want to keep your head.

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:20.121
<i>You came.</i>

01:06:21.956 --> 01:06:23.041
Who are you?

01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:24.584
<i>Me?</i>

01:06:27.003 --> 01:06:28.588
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

01:06:30.048 --> 01:06:32.467
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:36.846
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

01:06:37.388 --> 01:06:38.473
"Unmask"?

01:06:38.556 --> 01:06:39.724
<i>Yes.</i>

01:06:40.558 --> 01:06:43.394
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

01:06:43.478 --> 01:06:45.897
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

01:06:46.564 --> 01:06:48.900
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

01:06:48.983 --> 01:06:50.777
How am I a part of this?

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.779
<i>You'll see.</i>

01:06:52.862 --> 01:06:54.673
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

01:06:54.697 --> 01:06:56.783
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

01:06:56.866 --> 01:06:58.117
<i>We're live.</i>

01:06:58.201 --> 01:07:01.204
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

01:07:02.413 --> 01:07:03.581
<i>At the moment,</i>

01:07:03.665 --> 01:07:07.043
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

01:07:07.126 --> 01:07:08.169
<i>is dead.</i>

01:07:08.253 --> 01:07:10.314
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

01:07:10.338 --> 01:07:11.338
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:14.509
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

01:07:14.592 --> 01:07:17.595
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:07:17.679 --> 01:07:18.680
Okay.

01:07:27.438 --> 01:07:29.524
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

01:07:31.276 --> 01:07:33.444
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

01:07:35.488 --> 01:07:36.531
<i>Now,</i>

01:07:37.532 --> 01:07:40.326
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:43.997
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

01:07:44.581 --> 01:07:47.000
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:50.420
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

01:07:50.503 --> 01:07:55.717
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.052
You want me to do puzzles?

01:07:58.136 --> 01:08:00.889
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

01:08:00.972 --> 01:08:05.059
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

01:08:05.143 --> 01:08:07.478
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

01:08:07.562 --> 01:08:09.731
Okay, okay. So I just...

01:08:09.814 --> 01:08:11.000
You want me to...

01:08:11.024 --> 01:08:13.359
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

01:08:13.443 --> 01:08:17.071
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

01:08:17.155 --> 01:08:21.826
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:24.329
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

01:08:24.412 --> 01:08:25.496
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:26.998
- "Justice."
- Huh?

01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:28.124
The answer's "justice."

01:08:28.208 --> 01:08:29.417
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.085
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

01:08:31.169 --> 01:08:35.506
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:37.967
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

01:08:38.051 --> 01:08:40.428
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

01:08:40.511 --> 01:08:41.780
Of course, of course. Of course.

01:08:41.804 --> 01:08:44.182
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

01:08:44.265 --> 01:08:48.394
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

01:08:48.478 --> 01:08:52.649
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

01:08:52.732 --> 01:08:54.525
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:55.860
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

01:08:55.944 --> 01:08:58.172
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

01:08:59.530 --> 01:09:00.716
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.991
- How much?
- Nothing!

01:09:02.075 --> 01:09:04.285
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

01:09:04.369 --> 01:09:06.722
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

01:09:06.746 --> 01:09:07.580
What cases?

01:09:07.664 --> 01:09:08.789
He didn't ask me that!

01:09:08.872 --> 01:09:10.308
Come on! Ten grand.

01:09:10.332 --> 01:09:13.293
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

01:09:13.377 --> 01:09:16.004
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

01:09:16.088 --> 01:09:19.925
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

01:09:20.008 --> 01:09:22.427
<i>Last riddle.</i>

01:09:22.511 --> 01:09:26.848
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

01:09:26.932 --> 01:09:31.228
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

01:09:31.311 --> 01:09:33.397
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.024
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

01:09:36.108 --> 01:09:37.961
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

01:09:37.985 --> 01:09:39.194
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

01:09:39.278 --> 01:09:40.946
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

01:09:41.029 --> 01:09:43.049
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

01:09:43.073 --> 01:09:44.616
If I go out this way, it's just me.

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:47.828
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

01:09:47.911 --> 01:09:49.371
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

01:09:49.454 --> 01:09:50.849
- People are watching.
- What people?

01:09:50.873 --> 01:09:53.000
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

01:09:53.083 --> 01:09:55.252
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

01:09:55.335 --> 01:09:56.211
<i>Four!</i>

01:09:56.295 --> 01:09:57.730
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

01:09:57.754 --> 01:09:59.631
<i>Goodbye!</i>

01:10:29.828 --> 01:10:31.264
Who do you think he is under there?

01:10:31.288 --> 01:10:32.122
Take it easy.

01:10:32.206 --> 01:10:33.207
I want to see.

01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:35.981
What is that thing? Leather?

01:10:39.504 --> 01:10:40.964
What's he got on his eyes?

01:10:41.048 --> 01:10:42.567
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:43.860
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

01:10:43.884 --> 01:10:45.364
Hey!

01:10:45.636 --> 01:10:48.764
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:10:48.847 --> 01:10:50.515
Relax, God damn it!

01:10:50.599 --> 01:10:52.100
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

01:10:53.518 --> 01:10:56.063
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

01:10:56.146 --> 01:10:58.565
Colson's blood is on his hands.

01:10:58.649 --> 01:11:00.067
Maybe it's on yours.

01:11:01.526 --> 01:11:02.569
What'd you say?

01:11:02.653 --> 01:11:04.238
He would rather die than talk.

01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:06.323
What was he afraid of?

01:11:07.074 --> 01:11:08.158
You?

01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:16.708
You son of a bitch.

01:11:17.292 --> 01:11:20.295
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

01:11:20.379 --> 01:11:22.089
You could be an accessory to murder.

01:11:22.172 --> 01:11:23.274
Why are we playing games...

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.176
Get him! Come on!

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.262
Back off! Back off!

01:11:28.345 --> 01:11:30.639
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

01:11:30.722 --> 01:11:32.808
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

01:11:32.891 --> 01:11:35.686
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

01:11:38.355 --> 01:11:39.898
You too now?

01:11:39.982 --> 01:11:42.526
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

01:11:42.609 --> 01:11:45.195
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

01:11:45.279 --> 01:11:47.531
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

01:11:50.325 --> 01:11:51.827
Okay, give him the room.

01:12:07.467 --> 01:12:08.760
Two minutes.

01:12:20.522 --> 01:12:22.107
You listen to me.

01:12:23.692 --> 01:12:25.694
We gotta get you out of here.

01:12:27.362 --> 01:12:29.323
That would put a lot of heat on you.

01:12:29.406 --> 01:12:31.074
Well, you punched me in the face.

01:12:33.327 --> 01:12:34.620
Take this key.

01:12:35.913 --> 01:12:39.291
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

01:12:40.334 --> 01:12:42.094
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

01:12:43.045 --> 01:12:45.339
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

01:12:48.717 --> 01:12:51.094
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

01:12:54.514 --> 01:12:57.226
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

01:12:57.309 --> 01:13:00.229
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

01:13:01.146 --> 01:13:03.774
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

01:13:06.485 --> 01:13:08.445
Or he moonlights as a cop.

01:13:13.033 --> 01:13:14.593
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

01:13:14.618 --> 01:13:16.119
Somebody stop him!

01:13:54.323 --> 01:13:56.203
- There he is!
- Freeze!

01:14:42.246 --> 01:14:44.286
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

01:14:44.707 --> 01:14:45.917
I did.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.378
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

01:14:49.462 --> 01:14:51.505
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

01:14:51.589 --> 01:14:52.715
I only trust you.

01:14:52.798 --> 01:14:55.134
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

01:14:55.218 --> 01:14:58.596
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

01:14:59.347 --> 01:15:00.473
You think Penguin's the rat?

01:15:00.556 --> 01:15:03.601
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

01:15:03.684 --> 01:15:05.645
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

01:15:05.728 --> 01:15:07.063
DA was a regular too.

01:15:07.146 --> 01:15:10.650
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

01:15:11.734 --> 01:15:12.944
The <i>Rata A lad a.</i>

01:15:13.027 --> 01:15:14.027
The what?

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:15.529
Riddler's latest.

01:15:15.613 --> 01:15:17.323
The cipher in the maze.

01:15:17.406 --> 01:15:19.909
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

01:15:21.494 --> 01:15:23.120
A penguin's got wings too.

01:15:25.122 --> 01:15:27.083
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:28.894
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

01:15:28.918 --> 01:15:32.129
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

01:15:32.213 --> 01:15:35.383
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

01:15:38.010 --> 01:15:40.210
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

01:15:41.013 --> 01:15:42.098
There's Penguin.

01:15:42.181 --> 01:15:44.058
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

01:15:45.685 --> 01:15:46.936
<i>You want to move in?</i>

01:15:48.813 --> 01:15:50.273
<i>Let's follow.</i>

01:16:08.791 --> 01:16:12.336
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

01:16:12.461 --> 01:16:13.713
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:16.859
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

01:16:16.883 --> 01:16:19.385
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

01:16:38.613 --> 01:16:41.157
It's a drug lab. Drops.

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.450
This is a buy.

01:16:42.533 --> 01:16:45.703
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

01:16:45.786 --> 01:16:47.014
Or they never shut it down at all.

01:16:47.038 --> 01:16:47.914
<i>What are you saying?</i>

01:16:47.997 --> 01:16:51.125
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

01:17:15.483 --> 01:17:16.901
This just got complicated.

01:17:17.652 --> 01:17:18.819
What do you mean?

01:17:24.742 --> 01:17:26.202
Hey! What happened?

01:17:26.285 --> 01:17:27.620
You all right?

01:17:38.339 --> 01:17:40.132
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

01:17:40.258 --> 01:17:41.884
Jesus.

01:17:42.635 --> 01:17:44.470
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

01:17:44.971 --> 01:17:46.305
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

01:17:46.389 --> 01:17:48.099
Is that why you work in the club?

01:17:48.849 --> 01:17:49.892
It was all just a score?

01:17:49.976 --> 01:17:53.771
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

01:17:55.147 --> 01:17:57.066
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

01:18:08.369 --> 01:18:09.369
Jesus!

01:18:37.939 --> 01:18:39.065
Hey, Vengeance!

01:18:41.234 --> 01:18:43.945
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

01:19:24.819 --> 01:19:26.446
Kenzie! Get the money!

01:19:31.868 --> 01:19:33.119
Hey! What the...

01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:25.088
Whoa!

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:29.885
Come on! Come on!

01:20:33.054 --> 01:20:34.389
This guy's crazy!

01:20:36.141 --> 01:20:37.851
Come on! Hey!

01:21:27.317 --> 01:21:28.318
Move!

01:22:33.133 --> 01:22:35.010
Get out of the way!

01:22:46.146 --> 01:22:47.230
Come on!

01:22:55.947 --> 01:22:57.073
Get out of the way!

01:23:34.318 --> 01:23:36.362
I got you!

01:23:37.613 --> 01:23:38.948
I got you!

01:23:39.031 --> 01:23:41.367
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:42.910
I got you!

01:24:59.361 --> 01:25:02.198
What the hell is this?
Good cop, bat shit cop?

01:25:02.281 --> 01:25:04.909
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

01:25:04.992 --> 01:25:06.344
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:07.786
Cops caught you doing something.

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:09.556
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.457
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.667
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

01:25:13.751 --> 01:25:14.960
His drops operation.

01:25:15.044 --> 01:25:17.504
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

01:25:17.588 --> 01:25:21.217
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.111
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

01:25:23.135 --> 01:25:25.471
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:28.766
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

01:25:28.849 --> 01:25:30.017
What are you, crazy?

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.244
That why you killed the girl?

01:25:31.268 --> 01:25:32.268
I didn't kill no girl!

01:25:32.311 --> 01:25:34.104
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

01:25:34.188 --> 01:25:35.481
But she got too close, right?

01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:37.834
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

01:25:37.858 --> 01:25:39.818
But somehow Riddler found out too.

01:25:39.902 --> 01:25:41.820
He knows so much about you.

01:25:41.904 --> 01:25:43.948
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

01:25:44.532 --> 01:25:46.742
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

01:25:47.159 --> 01:25:48.439
Why don't you start harmonizing?

01:25:48.661 --> 01:25:51.330
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:52.748
I ain't no rat!

01:25:52.831 --> 01:25:54.726
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:55.894
if he heard this kind of talk?

01:25:55.918 --> 01:25:58.087
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

01:25:58.170 --> 01:26:00.714
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

01:26:00.798 --> 01:26:02.358
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

01:26:02.424 --> 01:26:04.051
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

01:26:04.134 --> 01:26:06.053
Open your eyes!

01:26:09.974 --> 01:26:11.559
Are you <i>El Rata A lad a?</i>

01:26:11.642 --> 01:26:13.143
<i>El Rata A lad a?</i>

01:26:13.227 --> 01:26:15.062
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

01:26:15.145 --> 01:26:17.481
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

01:26:17.565 --> 01:26:20.150
It says you are <i>El Rata A lad a.</i>

01:26:20.234 --> 01:26:21.610
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

01:26:21.694 --> 01:26:22.963
Why, you got something to tell us?

01:26:22.987 --> 01:26:23.987
Yeah!

01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:25.632
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

01:26:25.656 --> 01:26:26.656
What?

01:26:26.907 --> 01:26:28.242
It's <i>"La."</i>

01:26:28.325 --> 01:26:29.618
<i>"La" rata.</i>

01:26:30.119 --> 01:26:32.121
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

01:26:32.204 --> 01:26:34.081
Jesus! Look at you two.

01:26:34.498 --> 01:26:36.750
World's greatest detectives!

01:26:37.167 --> 01:26:39.521
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

01:26:39.545 --> 01:26:40.629
Jesus!

01:26:40.713 --> 01:26:42.214
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

01:26:42.298 --> 01:26:44.300
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

01:26:45.718 --> 01:26:46.838
You think he made a mistake?

01:26:46.886 --> 01:26:48.095
He doesn't make mistakes.

01:26:48.178 --> 01:26:49.221
A rat with wings?

01:26:49.305 --> 01:26:50.890
You know what that sounds like to me?

01:26:50.973 --> 01:26:54.143
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

01:26:54.226 --> 01:26:56.228
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

01:27:01.859 --> 01:27:05.738
"You are <i>el."</i>

01:27:14.413 --> 01:27:15.915
Maybe it was a mistake.

01:27:16.332 --> 01:27:17.166
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

01:27:17.249 --> 01:27:18.249
Wait.

01:27:21.503 --> 01:27:22.838
Is that him?

01:27:23.714 --> 01:27:25.549
Holy shit.

01:27:45.444 --> 01:27:47.324
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

01:28:16.432 --> 01:28:20.061
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

01:28:20.144 --> 01:28:22.981
But in a mansion, in a slum,

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:24.983
I'll never know where I come from.

01:28:25.858 --> 01:28:27.193
Do you know what I am?"

01:28:27.277 --> 01:28:28.278
Any idea?

01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:29.821
Yeah.

01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:32.490
It's an orphan.

01:28:41.374 --> 01:28:43.126
A mansion in a slum.

01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:47.309
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

01:28:47.338 --> 01:28:49.048
It was part of the Wayne estate.

01:28:49.674 --> 01:28:51.318
They donated it
after they built the tower.

01:28:51.342 --> 01:28:52.342
Let's go.

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:57.891
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.310
You gonna untie me?

01:29:00.393 --> 01:29:02.193
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

01:29:05.773 --> 01:29:06.774
Hey!

01:29:08.234 --> 01:29:10.653
You goddamn sons of bitches!

01:29:24.751 --> 01:29:26.920
No guns.

01:29:28.379 --> 01:29:30.423
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

01:29:51.528 --> 01:29:52.737
What's that?

01:30:03.248 --> 01:30:05.166
Hey! Hey!

01:30:11.631 --> 01:30:12.840
Drop heads.

01:30:20.265 --> 01:30:21.891
What the hell is that?

01:30:33.653 --> 01:30:36.030
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

01:30:36.114 --> 01:30:37.407
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

01:30:40.159 --> 01:30:42.203
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:44.205
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

01:30:45.957 --> 01:30:47.542
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

01:30:48.835 --> 01:30:50.628
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

01:30:51.838 --> 01:30:55.300
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

01:30:55.842 --> 01:30:57.635
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

01:30:57.719 --> 01:31:00.555
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

01:31:00.638 --> 01:31:03.975
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

01:31:04.517 --> 01:31:06.394
<i>Win or lose,</i>

01:31:06.477 --> 01:31:09.272
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:12.567
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

01:31:13.151 --> 01:31:17.197
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.199
<i>who need it now,</i>

01:31:19.282 --> 01:31:20.742
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

01:31:20.825 --> 01:31:22.243
"Sins of the father."

01:31:22.327 --> 01:31:24.787
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

01:31:27.248 --> 01:31:29.334
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

01:31:33.213 --> 01:31:35.423
Shall be visited upon the son.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:40.553
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

01:31:45.141 --> 01:31:46.559
Hey!

01:32:46.243 --> 01:32:48.787
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

01:32:48.871 --> 01:32:50.706
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

01:32:50.789 --> 01:32:52.416
Something terrible is gonna happen!

01:32:53.083 --> 01:32:55.168
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

01:33:06.972 --> 01:33:08.724
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

01:33:09.892 --> 01:33:11.560
I'm so sorry.

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.771
I've been trying to reach you.

01:33:17.524 --> 01:33:19.284
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

01:33:19.735 --> 01:33:23.488
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.846
We've sedated him.

01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:49.556
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

01:33:50.432 --> 01:33:53.143
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

01:33:53.685 --> 01:33:55.437
Is there anyone else to notify?

01:33:56.772 --> 01:33:58.190
Next of kin?

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:04.404
No.

01:34:05.531 --> 01:34:07.157
It's just me.

01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.511
Selina?

01:35:58.143 --> 01:35:59.144
<i>Can you see me?</i>

01:36:02.272 --> 01:36:04.691
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

01:36:05.567 --> 01:36:06.652
<i>Where can we go?</i>

01:36:25.337 --> 01:36:27.256
Cat burglar pulling another score?

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:30.801
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

01:36:30.884 --> 01:36:33.345
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

01:36:34.012 --> 01:36:35.764
How could they do that to her?

01:36:35.847 --> 01:36:37.808
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

01:36:37.891 --> 01:36:39.810
Her body was in his car.

01:36:39.893 --> 01:36:42.771
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

01:36:42.854 --> 01:36:45.857
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

01:36:45.941 --> 01:36:47.544
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:49.194
She didn't know any better.

01:36:49.278 --> 01:36:50.672
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

01:36:50.696 --> 01:36:52.256
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:36:52.322 --> 01:36:53.883
It means your choices have consequences.

01:36:53.907 --> 01:36:56.285
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

01:36:56.368 --> 01:36:59.079
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

01:36:59.162 --> 01:37:00.998
- Was it worth it?
- What?

01:37:01.331 --> 01:37:03.500
Compromising yourself for money?

01:37:04.877 --> 01:37:07.129
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

01:37:08.755 --> 01:37:12.425
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

01:37:12.508 --> 01:37:13.902
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:37:13.926 --> 01:37:15.261
Falcone owes me that money.

01:37:15.344 --> 01:37:17.096
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

01:37:17.179 --> 01:37:18.014
Oh, really? Why's that?

01:37:18.097 --> 01:37:19.015
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

01:37:19.098 --> 01:37:20.850
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

01:37:20.933 --> 01:37:21.934
would owe you anything.

01:37:22.018 --> 01:37:24.353
Because he's my father!

01:37:33.487 --> 01:37:36.282
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

01:37:37.783 --> 01:37:39.076
Just like Anni.

01:37:41.245 --> 01:37:43.789
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

01:37:45.875 --> 01:37:47.210
To the club?

01:37:48.127 --> 01:37:49.128
Yeah.

01:37:51.839 --> 01:37:54.717
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

01:37:55.176 --> 01:37:56.928
Used to see him there.

01:37:57.678 --> 01:37:59.680
He scared the shit out of me.

01:38:01.641 --> 01:38:05.102
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

01:38:05.645 --> 01:38:09.482
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.196
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

01:38:15.863 --> 01:38:17.365
Strangled.

01:38:17.782 --> 01:38:21.244
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.206
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

01:38:25.289 --> 01:38:27.458
and he didn't say a thing.

01:38:29.293 --> 01:38:31.087
Couldn't even look at me.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.592
He owes me that money.

01:38:38.386 --> 01:38:39.804
I'm sorry.

01:38:40.930 --> 01:38:42.098
For what I said.

01:38:43.474 --> 01:38:44.892
Oh, it's all right.

01:38:48.437 --> 01:38:50.523
You assume the worst in people.

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:52.817
Which, well...

01:38:55.111 --> 01:38:57.029
maybe we're not so different after all.

01:39:02.493 --> 01:39:04.245
Who are you under there?

01:39:10.334 --> 01:39:12.211
What are you hiding?

01:39:14.589 --> 01:39:16.424
Are you just...

01:39:18.009 --> 01:39:19.719
hideously scarred?

01:39:21.846 --> 01:39:22.847
Yeah.

01:39:30.104 --> 01:39:31.522
Listen to me.

01:39:33.065 --> 01:39:35.943
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

01:39:37.111 --> 01:39:41.782
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

01:39:42.408 --> 01:39:45.494
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

01:39:45.578 --> 01:39:46.829
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

01:39:46.913 --> 01:39:48.193
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

01:39:48.247 --> 01:39:50.291
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

01:39:50.374 --> 01:39:51.626
I think you'd be on his side.

01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:53.389
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

01:39:53.419 --> 01:39:55.379
What, do you live in a cave?

01:39:55.463 --> 01:39:57.548
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

01:39:58.633 --> 01:40:02.511
Listen, if I can find
that dick bag Kenzie,

01:40:02.595 --> 01:40:03.804
will you help me?

01:40:05.056 --> 01:40:06.349
Please.

01:40:09.143 --> 01:40:11.062
Come on, Vengeance.

01:40:13.522 --> 01:40:15.775
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

01:40:15.858 --> 01:40:17.618
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

01:40:27.036 --> 01:40:28.579
I told you, baby.

01:40:30.498 --> 01:40:33.084
I can take care of myself.

01:40:43.886 --> 01:40:47.181
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

01:40:55.022 --> 01:40:58.609
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

01:40:58.734 --> 01:41:00.570
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

01:41:00.778 --> 01:41:03.197
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

01:41:03.364 --> 01:41:04.824
<i>it's a passion.</i>

01:41:05.533 --> 01:41:07.869
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

01:41:09.078 --> 01:41:11.414
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

01:41:11.497 --> 01:41:13.958
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

01:41:14.041 --> 01:41:17.211
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

01:41:18.546 --> 01:41:23.217
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

01:41:23.301 --> 01:41:26.971
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.223
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

01:41:29.307 --> 01:41:31.809
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

01:41:31.893 --> 01:41:33.519
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

01:41:33.603 --> 01:41:39.191
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

01:41:39.275 --> 01:41:43.946
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:46.407
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

01:41:47.241 --> 01:41:49.743
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

01:41:49.826 --> 01:41:53.747
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

01:41:53.872 --> 01:41:55.916
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

01:41:56.416 --> 01:42:00.712
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

01:42:00.795 --> 01:42:03.381
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

01:42:03.506 --> 01:42:06.551
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

01:42:07.135 --> 01:42:12.390
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

01:42:12.891 --> 01:42:15.268
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

01:42:15.352 --> 01:42:17.729
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

01:42:17.812 --> 01:42:21.274
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

01:42:21.358 --> 01:42:24.152
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

01:42:25.695 --> 01:42:27.531
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:42:33.286 --> 01:42:34.371
Do you know who I am?

01:42:35.997 --> 01:42:37.123
You're Bruce Wayne.

01:42:37.207 --> 01:42:39.084
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

01:42:49.844 --> 01:42:50.845
See?

01:43:02.148 --> 01:43:04.776
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

01:43:05.527 --> 01:43:07.654
Must have made a fortune.

01:43:08.113 --> 01:43:09.993
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

01:43:11.366 --> 01:43:13.827
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:14.911
No, boss.

01:43:14.995 --> 01:43:17.330
$1,183.

01:43:17.914 --> 01:43:19.875
You know why communism failed, right?

01:43:19.958 --> 01:43:20.959
No, boss.

01:43:22.878 --> 01:43:24.129
Austerity.

01:43:26.381 --> 01:43:28.008
All right. All right.

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.677
Look at that. Perfect.

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.560
It's never gonna be that good again.

01:43:34.723 --> 01:43:37.225
Hey, Johnny Slick.

01:43:37.309 --> 01:43:38.476
What are you doing here?

01:43:40.395 --> 01:43:42.230
Give us a moment here, fellas.

01:43:43.148 --> 01:43:44.190
Come on.

01:43:46.109 --> 01:43:47.319
See ya, champ.

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:49.571
Come on, sweetheart.

01:43:51.531 --> 01:43:52.532
Have a seat.

01:43:54.576 --> 01:43:56.369
I thought I might hear from you.

01:43:57.537 --> 01:44:00.665
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:04.002
stirring things up, huh?

01:44:04.085 --> 01:44:05.795
- Is it true?
- What?

01:44:07.088 --> 01:44:08.715
That reporter business?

01:44:10.050 --> 01:44:11.319
What do you want to know here, kid?

01:44:11.343 --> 01:44:14.137
Did you kill him? For my father?

01:44:14.221 --> 01:44:16.973
Look, your father was in trouble.

01:44:17.849 --> 01:44:19.643
This reporter had some dirt.

01:44:19.726 --> 01:44:21.353
Some very...

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:26.274
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

01:44:26.358 --> 01:44:29.069
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

01:44:29.152 --> 01:44:30.671
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

01:44:30.695 --> 01:44:32.614
not right before the election.

01:44:33.073 --> 01:44:35.367
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:37.077
but he wasn't going for it.

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.330
So, he came to me.

01:44:40.413 --> 01:44:42.791
Well, I never seen him like that.

01:44:43.625 --> 01:44:45.460
He said, "Carmine,

01:44:46.253 --> 01:44:50.966
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

01:44:53.385 --> 01:44:56.304
And when fear isn't enough...

01:44:56.972 --> 01:44:58.807
Oof. Hmm.

01:45:00.141 --> 01:45:03.478
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

01:45:04.479 --> 01:45:06.314
I handled it.

01:45:08.024 --> 01:45:09.442
I know.

01:45:09.526 --> 01:45:11.778
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

01:45:13.029 --> 01:45:14.865
But you'd be surprised

01:45:14.948 --> 01:45:17.325
what even a good man like him

01:45:17.409 --> 01:45:19.995
is capable of in the right situation.

01:45:22.247 --> 01:45:23.707
Do me a favor.

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.084
Don't lose any sleep over it.

01:45:26.793 --> 01:45:28.378
This reporter

01:45:29.212 --> 01:45:30.797
was a lowlife.

01:45:30.881 --> 01:45:32.340
He was on Maroni's payroll.

01:45:33.967 --> 01:45:35.594
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:36.344 --> 01:45:39.598
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

01:45:41.016 --> 01:45:44.519
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

01:45:44.603 --> 01:45:46.938
that your father would be in my pocket,

01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:48.690
forever.

01:45:49.357 --> 01:45:51.401
He would have done anything

01:45:51.484 --> 01:45:53.653
to keep him from becoming mayor.

01:45:53.737 --> 01:45:55.071
You understand?

01:45:56.281 --> 01:46:00.827
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

01:46:00.911 --> 01:46:02.954
Do I know it for a fact?

01:46:05.373 --> 01:46:07.459
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

01:46:08.835 --> 01:46:11.129
This is what you wanted, huh?

01:46:11.213 --> 01:46:13.632
This little conversation here?

01:46:16.051 --> 01:46:18.220
It's been a long time coming, huh?

01:46:20.847 --> 01:46:22.974
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

01:47:32.376 --> 01:47:33.669
You lied to me...

01:47:36.505 --> 01:47:38.132
my whole life.

01:47:43.304 --> 01:47:45.347
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

01:47:48.434 --> 01:47:51.729
He told me what he did for my father.

01:47:55.733 --> 01:47:57.234
About Salvatore Maroni.

01:47:59.236 --> 01:48:01.947
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

01:48:02.031 --> 01:48:03.782
Had my father killed.

01:48:06.243 --> 01:48:08.454
Why didn't you tell me all this?

01:48:11.207 --> 01:48:15.753
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

01:48:15.836 --> 01:48:18.172
believing that he was a good man.

01:48:18.255 --> 01:48:19.840
He was a good man.

01:48:21.008 --> 01:48:22.718
You listen to me.

01:48:22.801 --> 01:48:26.222
Your father was a good man.

01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:31.769
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

01:48:31.852 --> 01:48:33.771
He had a man killed.

01:48:33.854 --> 01:48:34.939
Why?

01:48:36.106 --> 01:48:39.360
To protect his family image?

01:48:40.444 --> 01:48:41.695
His political aspirations?

01:48:41.779 --> 01:48:45.324
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:49.453
He was protecting your mother.

01:48:50.412 --> 01:48:53.958
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

01:48:54.041 --> 01:48:56.168
He cared about her,

01:48:56.252 --> 01:48:57.545
and you,

01:48:57.628 --> 01:49:00.548
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

01:49:00.631 --> 01:49:04.093
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

01:49:04.969 --> 01:49:08.305
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

01:49:08.389 --> 01:49:11.517
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.435
That's who Falcone is.

01:49:15.688 --> 01:49:17.898
And that was your father's mistake.

01:49:17.982 --> 01:49:20.025
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

01:49:20.109 --> 01:49:22.862
your father was distraught.

01:49:23.737 --> 01:49:26.949
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

01:49:27.032 --> 01:49:29.201
that he would confess everything.

01:49:30.703 --> 01:49:32.705
And that night,

01:49:32.788 --> 01:49:36.709
your father and your mother were killed.

01:49:42.214 --> 01:49:43.966
It was Falcone?

01:49:50.014 --> 01:49:52.141
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

01:49:56.854 --> 01:50:00.399
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

01:50:00.482 --> 01:50:03.235
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

01:50:03.319 --> 01:50:08.532
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

01:50:10.284 --> 01:50:14.163
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:16.624
I know you always blamed yourself.

01:50:16.707 --> 01:50:19.251
You were only a boy, Bruce.

01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:23.714
I could see the fear in your eyes,

01:50:25.132 --> 01:50:27.509
but I didn't know how to help.

01:50:27.593 --> 01:50:30.095
I could teach you how to fight,

01:50:31.472 --> 01:50:34.141
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

01:50:34.225 --> 01:50:36.060
You needed a father.

01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:40.439
And all you had was me.

01:50:42.816 --> 01:50:44.026
I'm sorry.

01:50:45.778 --> 01:50:47.696
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

01:50:54.495 --> 01:50:55.579
God.

01:50:58.624 --> 01:51:03.045
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

01:51:05.756 --> 01:51:07.883
I thought I'd mastered all that.

01:51:14.305 --> 01:51:15.557
I mean,

01:51:16.766 --> 01:51:18.893
I'm not afraid to die.

01:51:20.645 --> 01:51:23.022
I realize now there's something

01:51:24.148 --> 01:51:26.025
I haven't got past.

01:51:26.943 --> 01:51:28.695
This fear...

01:51:31.155 --> 01:51:34.117
of ever going through any of that again.

01:51:38.371 --> 01:51:40.582
Of losing somebody I care about.

01:52:31.174 --> 01:52:32.174
Hey.

01:52:32.217 --> 01:52:34.969
I saw the signal. That's not you?

01:52:35.053 --> 01:52:36.971
I thought it was you.

01:52:49.901 --> 01:52:51.444
- I found him!
- I see that.

01:52:51.528 --> 01:52:53.029
He had my shit and my phone.

01:52:53.112 --> 01:52:54.381
She left a message
the night they took her.

01:52:54.405 --> 01:52:55.323
She called me...

01:52:55.406 --> 01:52:57.116
Gordon! Help me out, man!

01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.493
She got my gun!

01:52:59.827 --> 01:53:01.538
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

01:53:03.081 --> 01:53:05.625
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

01:53:10.213 --> 01:53:12.298
Here. Listen.

01:53:14.259 --> 01:53:15.927
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

01:53:16.052 --> 01:53:18.252
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

01:53:18.304 --> 01:53:20.390
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

01:53:20.473 --> 01:53:21.808
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

01:53:21.891 --> 01:53:23.601
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

01:53:23.685 --> 01:53:24.787
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

01:53:24.811 --> 01:53:26.104
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

01:53:26.187 --> 01:53:28.857
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

01:53:30.733 --> 01:53:32.777
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

01:53:33.486 --> 01:53:36.030
<i>- What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
<i>- No, nothing. He...</i>

01:53:36.114 --> 01:53:39.033
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

01:53:39.117 --> 01:53:41.828
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

01:53:42.370 --> 01:53:44.372
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

01:53:45.081 --> 01:53:47.959
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

01:53:48.042 --> 01:53:50.753
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

01:53:50.837 --> 01:53:53.023
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

01:53:53.047 --> 01:53:56.175
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

01:53:57.010 --> 01:53:59.554
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

01:54:00.638 --> 01:54:01.973
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

01:54:02.765 --> 01:54:06.311
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

01:54:06.811 --> 01:54:08.021
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

01:54:08.104 --> 01:54:10.064
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

01:54:10.148 --> 01:54:11.441
<i>The deal.</i>

01:54:11.524 --> 01:54:16.446
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

01:54:16.529 --> 01:54:19.240
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

01:54:19.324 --> 01:54:21.701
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

01:54:21.784 --> 01:54:22.911
<i>Right.</i>

01:54:23.661 --> 01:54:25.038
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:54:25.997 --> 01:54:28.166
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.234
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

01:54:37.258 --> 01:54:38.801
Jesus, he's strangling her.

01:54:38.885 --> 01:54:41.930
<i>Take it easy.</i>

01:54:51.147 --> 01:54:52.440
<i>Rata A lad a.</i>

01:54:57.195 --> 01:54:58.988
A falcon has wings too.

01:54:59.322 --> 01:55:01.157
Falcone is the rat?

01:55:12.126 --> 01:55:15.296
Falcone works for you guys?

01:55:15.964 --> 01:55:18.508
The mayor? The DA?

01:55:21.511 --> 01:55:22.595
No.

01:55:25.682 --> 01:55:26.975
We work for him.

01:55:27.976 --> 01:55:29.227
Everybody does.

01:55:29.310 --> 01:55:30.311
How?

01:55:30.395 --> 01:55:31.980
Through Renewal.

01:55:32.772 --> 01:55:34.148
Renewal is everything.

01:55:34.232 --> 01:55:35.632
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

01:55:36.150 --> 01:55:39.863
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

01:55:39.946 --> 01:55:43.533
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

01:55:43.616 --> 01:55:46.995
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

01:55:47.078 --> 01:55:49.163
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

01:55:49.247 --> 01:55:50.956
Everybody got a piece.

01:55:51.039 --> 01:55:52.875
But Falcone wanted more.

01:55:54.668 --> 01:55:57.880
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

01:55:59.298 --> 01:56:01.633
He'd rat out his drops operation,

01:56:02.009 --> 01:56:04.720
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

01:56:04.803 --> 01:56:07.264
then install them all as his puppets.

01:56:07.347 --> 01:56:09.892
You think this goddamn election matters?

01:56:11.518 --> 01:56:13.437
Falcone's the mayor.

01:56:14.396 --> 01:56:16.899
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

01:56:16.982 --> 01:56:18.358
Come on, Vengeance.

01:56:19.067 --> 01:56:20.903
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

01:56:21.612 --> 01:56:23.298
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

01:56:23.322 --> 01:56:24.156
No!

01:56:25.616 --> 01:56:26.825
We'll get him.

01:56:27.492 --> 01:56:29.369
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

01:56:29.453 --> 01:56:30.579
He owns the city!

01:56:30.662 --> 01:56:31.914
Cross that line...

01:56:32.706 --> 01:56:33.999
you'll become just like him.

01:56:34.708 --> 01:56:36.251
Listen to me.

01:56:36.335 --> 01:56:38.212
Don't throw your life away.

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.136
Don't worry, honey.

01:56:49.223 --> 01:56:50.682
I got nine of 'em.

01:56:50.807 --> 01:56:52.768
No, don't! Hey, hey!

01:56:54.061 --> 01:56:55.354
Oh, God!

01:57:04.655 --> 01:57:05.924
She won't get out of there alive.

01:57:05.948 --> 01:57:08.534
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

01:57:08.617 --> 01:57:09.618
I have to stop her.

01:57:09.785 --> 01:57:10.785
Don't you mean "we"?

01:57:12.079 --> 01:57:13.622
I gotta do this my way.

01:57:13.956 --> 01:57:14.957
And then what?

01:57:15.832 --> 01:57:17.209
We do what Riddler said.

01:57:18.043 --> 01:57:19.670
Bring the rat into the light.

01:57:55.622 --> 01:57:57.666
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

01:57:57.749 --> 01:57:59.209
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

01:57:59.835 --> 01:58:01.169
Tell him it's about Annika.

01:58:04.423 --> 01:58:05.757
Hey!

01:58:06.592 --> 01:58:08.010
Look who it is, huh?

01:58:08.093 --> 01:58:10.512
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

01:58:10.596 --> 01:58:12.598
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

01:58:12.764 --> 01:58:14.224
Absolutely.

01:58:15.976 --> 01:58:16.977
Alone?

01:58:33.535 --> 01:58:34.620
Hey!

01:58:45.172 --> 01:58:46.441
I'm just so worried.

01:58:46.465 --> 01:58:48.091
I don't know where she is.

01:58:49.843 --> 01:58:53.222
And I know
that you're a very important man.

01:58:53.305 --> 01:58:56.725
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

01:58:58.227 --> 01:59:00.604
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

01:59:02.064 --> 01:59:03.190
I'm sorry.

01:59:03.398 --> 01:59:04.483
It's okay.

01:59:04.566 --> 01:59:06.693
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:09.738
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

01:59:13.992 --> 01:59:14.910
Mr. Falcone?

01:59:14.993 --> 01:59:16.453
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

01:59:16.537 --> 01:59:19.456
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

01:59:21.833 --> 01:59:23.335
I'm sorry, beautiful.

01:59:23.418 --> 01:59:24.836
I'll be right back.

01:59:40.143 --> 01:59:41.228
Holy shit.

01:59:41.311 --> 01:59:43.039
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

01:59:43.063 --> 01:59:45.774

01:59:45.858 --> 01:59:48.694

01:59:51.613 --> 01:59:55.117
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

01:59:55.242 --> 01:59:56.785
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

01:59:56.952 --> 01:59:58.620
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

01:59:58.704 --> 02:00:00.205
<i>The deal.</i>

02:00:00.289 --> 02:00:05.085
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

02:00:05.168 --> 02:00:08.088
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

02:00:08.171 --> 02:00:10.716
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

02:00:10.799 --> 02:00:11.800
<i>Right.</i>

02:00:12.676 --> 02:00:13.886
<i>Hmm.</i>

02:00:13.969 --> 02:00:15.178

02:00:26.732 --> 02:00:27.983
Hey, Dad.

02:00:29.026 --> 02:00:30.026
What?

02:00:30.484 --> 02:00:32.528
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

02:00:34.155 --> 02:00:35.615
You remember her?

02:00:37.658 --> 02:00:38.701
Yeah.

02:00:42.997 --> 02:00:44.141
Just put down the gun, honey.

02:00:44.165 --> 02:00:45.249
This is for my mother.

02:01:42.515 --> 02:01:43.683
I see him!

02:02:27.727 --> 02:02:29.478
You don't think this hurts me?

02:02:34.066 --> 02:02:36.360
My own flesh and blood, huh?

02:02:52.752 --> 02:02:54.587
You made me do this.

02:02:56.005 --> 02:02:57.798
Just like your mother.

02:03:03.804 --> 02:03:05.139
He has to pay!

02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:10.300
You don't have to pay with him.

02:03:13.814 --> 02:03:15.316
You paid enough.

02:03:49.892 --> 02:03:51.018
Jesus.

02:03:51.102 --> 02:03:53.813
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

02:03:53.896 --> 02:03:56.983
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

02:03:57.066 --> 02:03:58.317
I'm gonna start crying,

02:03:58.401 --> 02:04:00.903
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

02:04:00.987 --> 02:04:02.613
Let me tell you something.

02:04:02.697 --> 02:04:04.407
Whatever I know,

02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:06.367
whatever I've done,

02:04:06.450 --> 02:04:10.788
it's all going with me to my grave.

02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:23.301
What, are you with Zorro over here?

02:04:24.927 --> 02:04:27.221
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

02:04:35.146 --> 02:04:37.481
I guess we don't all work for you.

02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:48.034
You have the right to remain silent.

02:04:48.868 --> 02:04:52.371
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

02:04:52.455 --> 02:04:53.815
You have the right to an attorney.

02:04:53.873 --> 02:04:55.041
If you cannot afford one,

02:04:55.124 --> 02:04:56.918
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

02:04:57.001 --> 02:04:58.711
Do you understand these rights?

02:05:00.213 --> 02:05:01.797
Do you understand?

02:05:03.758 --> 02:05:04.842
Yeah.

02:05:04.926 --> 02:05:07.011
I'll see you when I walk out.

02:05:07.094 --> 02:05:08.155
With these rights in mind,

02:05:08.179 --> 02:05:09.531
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

02:05:09.555 --> 02:05:10.805
Goddamn rat.

02:05:12.766 --> 02:05:14.100
What'd you say?

02:05:14.184 --> 02:05:15.936
Enjoy your night at Black gate, Carmine.

02:05:17.062 --> 02:05:18.313
Probably be your last.

02:05:18.563 --> 02:05:21.608
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

02:05:21.691 --> 02:05:22.776
Maybe I am.

02:05:22.859 --> 02:05:24.069
Really, Oz?

02:05:24.152 --> 02:05:28.865
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

02:05:28.949 --> 02:05:30.033
I'll spray paint your ass!

02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:35.440
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

02:05:35.664 --> 02:05:37.666
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.460
Get your hands off of me!

02:06:00.021 --> 02:06:02.023
"Bring him into the light.

02:06:05.610 --> 02:06:07.571
And you'll find where I'm at."

02:06:07.654 --> 02:06:08.738
There!

02:06:08.822 --> 02:06:10.657
The shots came from up there!

02:06:12.242 --> 02:06:13.243
It's Riddler.

02:06:15.328 --> 02:06:16.496
Gage, on me.

02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:19.291
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

02:07:33.490 --> 02:07:34.699
He's gone.

02:07:44.501 --> 02:07:46.461
He's been here this whole time.

02:07:46.545 --> 02:07:48.880
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

02:07:48.964 --> 02:07:50.149
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

02:07:50.173 --> 02:07:52.902
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

02:07:52.926 --> 02:07:55.387
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:58.390
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

02:08:13.905 --> 02:08:15.991
Police! Hands up!

02:08:19.035 --> 02:08:22.539
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

02:08:41.683 --> 02:08:43.602
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

02:08:46.563 --> 02:08:47.856
Stay still!

02:08:47.939 --> 02:08:48.940
Now!

02:09:17.594 --> 02:09:19.387
Which one is you?

02:09:19.471 --> 02:09:20.972
You tell me.

02:09:21.806 --> 02:09:23.266
Let's go, pencil-neck.

02:09:26.353 --> 02:09:28.104
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

02:09:42.619 --> 02:09:45.539
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

02:09:45.622 --> 02:09:48.208

02:09:48.291 --> 02:09:50.876
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:52.002
Hey.

02:10:16.443 --> 02:10:18.153
What are all these diaries?

02:10:18.237 --> 02:10:20.656
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

02:10:20.739 --> 02:10:24.285
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

02:10:24.368 --> 02:10:25.911
Got something back on one of the IDs.

02:10:25.995 --> 02:10:28.289
Edward Nash ton. Works at KTMJ.

02:10:28.372 --> 02:10:30.207
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

02:10:30.291 --> 02:10:32.710
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

02:10:32.793 --> 02:10:34.545
What about chain of evidence?

02:10:35.379 --> 02:10:36.589
You should see this.

02:10:42.553 --> 02:10:44.054
He's wearing gloves.

02:10:45.514 --> 02:10:47.766
"Friday, July 16th.

02:10:47.850 --> 02:10:51.562
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

02:10:51.896 --> 02:10:54.940
suffocating my mind, no escape.

02:10:55.024 --> 02:10:56.442
But then, today, I saw it.

02:10:56.525 --> 02:11:00.654
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

02:11:01.989 --> 02:11:03.782
'Renewal.'

02:11:03.866 --> 02:11:08.287
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

02:11:08.370 --> 02:11:11.498
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

02:11:11.582 --> 02:11:14.919
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

02:11:15.002 --> 02:11:17.463
The moment when I would learn the truth.

02:11:17.546 --> 02:11:20.549
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

02:11:21.675 --> 02:11:23.570
"If you want people to understand,

02:11:23.594 --> 02:11:25.429
really understand,

02:11:25.512 --> 02:11:27.806
you can't just give them the answers.

02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:29.350
You have to confront them,

02:11:29.433 --> 02:11:31.852
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

02:11:31.936 --> 02:11:34.104
just like they tortured me.

02:11:34.188 --> 02:11:36.982
I know now what I must become."

02:11:39.944 --> 02:11:41.278
Jesus.

02:11:47.368 --> 02:11:49.328
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:51.372
This one's not a rat.

02:12:08.013 --> 02:12:09.139
What is that?

02:12:40.754 --> 02:12:42.023
Some kind of pry tool?

02:12:42.047 --> 02:12:43.424
Is it a chisel?

02:12:43.507 --> 02:12:44.967
It's a murder weapon.

02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:46.427
He killed Mitchell with it.

02:12:47.094 --> 02:12:49.972
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

02:12:58.564 --> 02:13:00.566
"My confession"?

02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:03.527
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

02:13:03.611 --> 02:13:04.987
This isn't over.

02:13:05.070 --> 02:13:07.590
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

02:13:07.907 --> 02:13:10.117
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

02:13:18.209 --> 02:13:20.419
His final post was last night.

02:13:20.502 --> 02:13:23.714
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

02:13:23.797 --> 02:13:26.800
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

02:13:26.926 --> 02:13:30.346
Take some time, but we'll get in.

02:13:41.690 --> 02:13:44.235
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

02:13:45.861 --> 02:13:47.571
"The Truth Unmasked."

02:13:48.405 --> 02:13:50.032
I think I'm his last target.

02:13:52.618 --> 02:13:53.702
You?

02:13:54.078 --> 02:13:56.121
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

02:13:56.664 --> 02:13:58.040
What is?

02:13:58.499 --> 02:13:59.917
The Batman.

02:14:05.297 --> 02:14:06.465
Yeah?

02:14:17.768 --> 02:14:18.978
Right.

02:14:21.856 --> 02:14:25.818
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

02:14:33.283 --> 02:14:34.784
You're a good cop.

<i>What do you want from me?</i>

02:15:04.439 --> 02:15:05.982
"Want"?

02:15:06.566 --> 02:15:10.195
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

02:15:11.404 --> 02:15:12.739
<i>For this moment.</i>

02:15:13.781 --> 02:15:16.784
I've been invisible my whole life.

02:15:17.869 --> 02:15:20.496
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:24.459
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

02:15:24.542 --> 02:15:26.377
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

02:15:36.763 --> 02:15:38.723
<i>Bruce...</i>

02:15:41.601 --> 02:15:43.436
<i>Wayne.</i>

02:15:45.813 --> 02:15:49.567

<i>Wayne.</i>

02:16:05.124 --> 02:16:07.544
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

02:16:13.591 --> 02:16:15.969
<i>made all those promises.</i>

02:16:18.429 --> 02:16:22.684
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

02:16:23.226 --> 02:16:26.771
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

02:16:26.855 --> 02:16:30.525
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:32.652
<i>Orphan.</i>

02:16:38.324 --> 02:16:43.454
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

02:16:44.747 --> 02:16:49.377
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

02:16:50.044 --> 02:16:51.588
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

02:16:54.215 --> 02:16:56.885
Do you know what being an orphan is?

02:16:57.260 --> 02:16:59.846
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

02:17:01.139 --> 02:17:05.185
<i>Twelve years old and already a drop head,
numbing the pain.</i>

02:17:06.895 --> 02:17:11.566
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

02:17:12.734 --> 02:17:15.904
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

02:17:15.987 --> 02:17:18.281
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

02:17:19.574 --> 02:17:22.160
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

02:17:25.079 --> 02:17:28.249
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

02:17:28.333 --> 02:17:31.252
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

02:17:31.336 --> 02:17:32.337
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

02:17:33.796 --> 02:17:35.840
<i>Bruce...</i>

02:17:36.883 --> 02:17:38.801
<i>Wayne.</i>

<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

02:17:53.566 --> 02:17:57.445
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

02:18:00.615 --> 02:18:01.783
<i>God.</i>

02:18:02.784 --> 02:18:04.077
<i>Look at you.</i>

02:18:05.745 --> 02:18:08.206
Your mask is amazing.

02:18:08.289 --> 02:18:11.209
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

02:18:11.292 --> 02:18:12.377
Ain't it funny?

02:18:12.460 --> 02:18:16.881
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

02:18:18.341 --> 02:18:20.385
<i>You and I both know</i>

02:18:21.344 --> 02:18:23.846
I'm looking at the real you right now.

02:18:23.930 --> 02:18:27.559
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

02:18:27.642 --> 02:18:29.185
<i>No shame,</i>

02:18:30.103 --> 02:18:31.104
<i>no limits.</i>

02:18:31.187 --> 02:18:32.856
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

02:18:33.731 --> 02:18:34.732
<i>What do you mean?</i>

02:18:34.816 --> 02:18:36.526
<i>All those cards.</i>

02:18:36.609 --> 02:18:37.819
<i>I told you,</i>

02:18:38.528 --> 02:18:40.506
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

02:18:40.530 --> 02:18:42.740
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

02:18:42.824 --> 02:18:44.284
<i>What did we just do?</i>

02:18:44.367 --> 02:18:46.428
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

02:18:46.452 --> 02:18:47.620
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

02:18:47.704 --> 02:18:48.705
<i>We're not a team.</i>

02:18:48.788 --> 02:18:51.291
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

02:18:51.374 --> 02:18:53.793
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

02:18:53.877 --> 02:18:57.046
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

02:18:57.130 --> 02:18:58.770
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:00.049
You gave me that.

02:19:00.133 --> 02:19:01.259
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

02:19:01.342 --> 02:19:03.928
You showed me what was possible.

02:19:04.012 --> 02:19:08.892
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

02:19:08.975 --> 02:19:10.518
<i>You inspired me.</i>

02:19:10.602 --> 02:19:12.102
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

02:19:13.228 --> 02:19:14.313
<i>What?</i>

02:19:14.396 --> 02:19:16.565
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

02:19:16.648 --> 02:19:18.025
<i>How can you say that?</i>

02:19:18.108 --> 02:19:19.610
You think you'll be remembered?

02:19:19.693 --> 02:19:21.361
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

02:19:21.862 --> 02:19:23.614
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

02:19:23.697 --> 02:19:25.365
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

02:19:25.449 --> 02:19:26.491
<i>No, no!</i>

02:19:26.575 --> 02:19:27.575
<i>A nobody!</i>

02:19:29.286 --> 02:19:31.079
<i>No!</i>

02:19:32.998 --> 02:19:35.375
<i>Ahhh!</i>

02:19:35.626 --> 02:19:38.212
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

02:19:39.171 --> 02:19:42.799
<i>Ahhh!</i>

02:19:42.883 --> 02:19:45.510
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

02:19:46.511 --> 02:19:48.513
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

02:19:48.889 --> 02:19:52.184
We could watch the whole thing together.

02:19:52.267 --> 02:19:53.268
<i>Watch what?</i>

02:19:53.352 --> 02:19:55.103
<i>Everything!</i>

02:20:03.445 --> 02:20:05.113
<i>It was all there.</i>

02:20:07.282 --> 02:20:09.618
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

02:20:13.914 --> 02:20:17.834
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:21.964
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

02:20:22.422 --> 02:20:23.674
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:24.383 --> 02:20:29.263
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

02:20:32.099 --> 02:20:33.934
<i>You.</i>

02:20:35.602 --> 02:20:37.729
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

02:20:39.064 --> 02:20:40.607
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:47.990
<i>Ave Maria</i>

02:20:48.407 --> 02:20:50.284
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:52.744 --> 02:20:54.121
<i>Gratia plena</i>

02:20:54.288 --> 02:20:55.706
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:59.710 --> 02:21:03.088
<i>Maria</i>

02:21:03.255 --> 02:21:08.802
<i>Gratia plena</i>

What are you doing in here?

02:22:02.272 --> 02:22:04.858
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

02:22:11.448 --> 02:22:13.909
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

02:22:14.785 --> 02:22:17.538
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

02:22:22.209 --> 02:22:25.254
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

02:22:25.337 --> 02:22:27.506
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

02:22:27.589 --> 02:22:29.841
It's a tucker.

02:22:47.651 --> 02:22:48.652
Huh.

02:23:03.834 --> 02:23:06.628
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

02:23:06.712 --> 02:23:08.213
What are you doing?

02:23:38.744 --> 02:23:40.162
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

02:23:40.495 --> 02:23:42.706
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

02:23:42.789 --> 02:23:45.751
<i>and a special thanks to everyone

02:23:45.834 --> 02:23:46.835
Detonators?

02:23:46.919 --> 02:23:51.964
<i>I just want to say this will be my last

02:24:07.271 --> 02:24:08.356
Jesus.

<i>Tomorrow's Election Day.</i>

<i>She promised real change.</i>

<i>But we know the truth, don't we?</i>

02:24:26.499 --> 02:24:28.584
<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

02:24:28.668 --> 02:24:30.545
<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:33.589
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

02:24:33.673 --> 02:24:37.510
<i>masquerading under the guise of renewal.</i>

02:24:37.593 --> 02:24:41.430

02:24:43.641 --> 02:24:47.645
<i>The day of judgment is finally upon us.</i>

02:24:47.728 --> 02:24:50.106
<i>And now it is time</i>

02:24:53.651 --> 02:24:56.445

02:25:00.283 --> 02:25:02.159
<i>And on the big night,</i>

Boom!

Boom!

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

<i>Those who are not washed away</i>

Call Gordon.

02:25:44.994 --> 02:25:47.121
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

<i>As breaking news</i>

<i>...celebrations will turn to panic,</i>

02:25:55.504 --> 02:26:00.343

02:26:01.719 --> 02:26:05.723
<i>And that's where all of you come in.</i>

02:26:12.146 --> 02:26:15.441
<i>Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.</i>

02:26:15.525 --> 02:26:17.693

<i>We'll give them real, real change now.</i>

02:26:52.019 --> 02:26:57.024
<i>We've spent our lives in this
wretched place,</i> <i>suffering!</i>

02:26:57.483 --> 02:26:59.986
<i>Wondering, "Why us?"</i>

02:27:00.069 --> 02:27:03.197
<i>Now they will spend

02:27:03.281 --> 02:27:05.449
<i>why them?</i>

02:27:05.533 --> 02:27:07.577
I can't get through! The lines are down.

02:27:13.207 --> 02:27:15.376
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.587
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:20.548
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

02:27:20.631 --> 02:27:22.651
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

02:27:32.226 --> 02:27:33.954
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

02:27:33.978 --> 02:27:35.539
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

02:27:35.563 --> 02:27:37.398
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:38.733
We got an active situation.

02:27:38.858 --> 02:27:40.210
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

02:27:40.234 --> 02:27:41.503
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

02:27:41.527 --> 02:27:42.445
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

02:27:42.528 --> 02:27:43.362
Come!

02:28:19.398 --> 02:28:20.876
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:21.776
...we're gonna have huge problems.

02:28:21.859 --> 02:28:23.295
The water's already started to breach.

02:28:23.319 --> 02:28:24.922
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

02:28:24.946 --> 02:28:27.216
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:29.134
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

02:28:29.158 --> 02:28:31.552
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

02:28:31.576 --> 02:28:33.888
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

02:28:33.912 --> 02:28:36.164
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

02:28:36.248 --> 02:28:38.083
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

02:28:38.166 --> 02:28:41.169
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

02:28:41.253 --> 02:28:42.754
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

02:28:47.926 --> 02:28:51.388
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

02:28:51.471 --> 02:28:53.765
Please! I just need your attention!

02:29:09.656 --> 02:29:10.782
You're okay!

02:30:41.706 --> 02:30:44.334
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

02:30:44.417 --> 02:30:45.627
Follow me, sir.

02:32:55.632 --> 02:32:57.133
No, no. It's okay.

02:32:57.217 --> 02:32:58.260
It's okay.

02:32:59.427 --> 02:33:00.470
It's okay.

02:33:02.097 --> 02:33:04.224
It's done now. It's done.

02:33:06.935 --> 02:33:08.270
It's over.

02:34:04.116 --> 02:34:07.578
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

02:34:08.287 --> 02:34:10.623
Take it easy. Easy.

02:34:39.193 --> 02:34:40.319
Jesus.

02:34:50.162 --> 02:34:51.830
Who the hell are you?

02:34:56.043 --> 02:34:57.044
Me?

02:35:00.214 --> 02:35:01.632
I'm Vengeance.

<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

02:38:50.777 --> 02:38:52.403
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

02:38:55.615 --> 02:38:59.327
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

02:38:59.410 --> 02:39:01.955
<i>in the parts of the city

02:39:03.122 --> 02:39:06.834
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

02:39:09.796 --> 02:39:12.924
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

02:39:14.300 --> 02:39:15.677
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

02:39:16.302 --> 02:39:17.762
But not just our city.

02:39:18.471 --> 02:39:22.684
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

02:39:22.767 --> 02:39:24.853
in our elected officials,

02:39:24.936 --> 02:39:26.229
in each other.

02:39:27.021 --> 02:39:30.358
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

02:39:34.696 --> 02:39:36.364
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

02:39:37.824 --> 02:39:39.993

02:39:42.078 --> 02:39:43.997

02:39:46.374 --> 02:39:49.419

<i>I have to become more.</i>

02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:02.307
<i>People need hope.</i>

02:40:03.516 --> 02:40:05.727
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

02:40:09.522 --> 02:40:11.191
<i>The city's angry,</i>

02:40:12.108 --> 02:40:13.484

<i>like me.</i>

02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:19.866
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

02:40:21.242 --> 02:40:23.953
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:27.332
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

02:40:28.833 --> 02:40:30.710
<i>they can transform us.</i>

02:40:32.587 --> 02:40:34.505
<i>They can give us the power</i>

02:40:35.465 --> 02:40:36.966
<i>to endure...</i>

02:40:38.343 --> 02:40:40.470
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

02:40:43.389 --> 02:40:45.558
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

02:40:45.642 --> 02:40:48.436
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:50.104
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

02:40:50.188 --> 02:40:51.874
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

02:40:51.898 --> 02:40:54.901
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

02:40:54.984 --> 02:40:57.529
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

02:40:57.612 --> 02:41:00.007
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

02:41:00.031 --> 02:41:02.492
Isn't that just terrible?

02:41:03.868 --> 02:41:05.787
Him...

02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:08.748
raining on your parade like that?

02:41:14.462 --> 02:41:16.464
What is it they say?

02:41:17.632 --> 02:41:19.801
"One day you're on top,

02:41:21.344 --> 02:41:23.012
the next...

02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:26.307
you're a clown."

02:41:28.685 --> 02:41:29.853
Well,

02:41:31.646 --> 02:41:34.482
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

02:41:36.776 --> 02:41:39.445
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

02:41:40.738 --> 02:41:42.574
You did so well.

02:41:47.078 --> 02:41:48.079
And you know,

02:41:49.747 --> 02:41:52.959
Gotham loves a comeback story.

02:42:03.011 --> 02:42:04.387
Who are you?

02:42:04.929 --> 02:42:07.348
Well, that's the question,

02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:09.767
isn't it?

02:42:12.687 --> 02:42:15.064
Riddle me this...

02:42:17.525 --> 02:42:19.652
"The less of them you have,

02:42:20.403 --> 02:42:24.240
the more one is worth."

02:42:29.662 --> 02:42:31.414
A friend.

02:42:57.648 --> 02:42:59.048
You're leaving.

02:42:59.566 --> 02:43:00.651
Jesus.

02:43:02.402 --> 02:43:03.987
Don't you ever just say hello?

02:43:09.076 --> 02:43:10.494
Where will you go?

02:43:11.995 --> 02:43:14.414
I don't know. Upstate.

02:43:14.831 --> 02:43:16.542
Bludhaven, maybe.

02:43:17.417 --> 02:43:18.418
Why?

02:43:19.628 --> 02:43:20.837
You asking me to stay?

02:43:27.886 --> 02:43:30.013
You know this place
is never gonna change.

02:43:30.430 --> 02:43:32.766
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

02:43:32.850 --> 02:43:34.768
There's gonna be a power grab.

02:43:36.395 --> 02:43:37.521
It'll be bloody.

02:43:38.146 --> 02:43:39.356
I know.

02:43:40.899 --> 02:43:41.984
But the city can change.

02:43:42.067 --> 02:43:43.318
It won't.

02:43:44.444 --> 02:43:45.445
I have to try.

02:43:45.529 --> 02:43:47.329
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

02:43:49.616 --> 02:43:50.742
Listen.

02:43:53.161 --> 02:43:54.413
Why don't you come with me?

02:43:55.372 --> 02:43:56.874
Get into some trouble.

02:43:57.624 --> 02:44:01.128
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

02:44:01.795 --> 02:44:03.422
The bat and the cat.

02:44:04.923 --> 02:44:06.592
It's got a nice ring.

02:44:19.938 --> 02:44:21.356
Who am I kidding?

02:44:22.816 --> 02:44:24.943
You're already spoken for.

02:44:36.830 --> 02:44:38.248
You should go.

02:44:46.590 --> 02:44:47.591
Selina...

02:44:51.678 --> 02:44:53.347
Take care of yourself.
