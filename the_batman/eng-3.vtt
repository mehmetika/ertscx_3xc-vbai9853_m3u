00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:27.866
Hey!

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:57.562
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.569
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

00:02:04.653 --> 00:02:06.196
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:08.615
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:02:08.698 --> 00:02:12.535
<i>And 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:14.120
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

00:02:14.204 --> 00:02:17.666
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.795
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

00:02:21.878 --> 00:02:23.630
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:26.466
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.069
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

00:02:28.093 --> 00:02:32.264
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:35.141
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:36.661
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:37.602
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:39.938
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:41.064
<i>Under my administration,</i>

00:02:41.147 --> 00:02:44.943
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

00:02:45.026 --> 00:02:48.530
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:50.907
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:51.991
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:53.386
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.428
<i>But listen...</i>

00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:55.930
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:57.414
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:02.919
Hey.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.090
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:13.972
Why is she still tied?

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.563
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:31.072
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:33.033
Just call me in the morning, okay?

00:03:36.244 --> 00:03:38.723
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:41.291
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

00:03:41.374 --> 00:03:44.044
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.833
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:21.432
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:26.270
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

00:05:29.773 --> 00:05:33.235
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

00:05:34.153 --> 00:05:36.238
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.241
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

00:05:40.284 --> 00:05:41.994
<i>Watching.</i>

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:48.000
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.175
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

00:06:09.813 --> 00:06:11.791
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:14.443
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

00:06:14.526 --> 00:06:16.028
<i>It's a big city.</i>

00:06:20.658 --> 00:06:22.368
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

00:06:32.962 --> 00:06:34.880
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

00:06:40.052 --> 00:06:41.804
Look at this guy, man.

00:06:47.142 --> 00:06:48.142
Boom!

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:49.311
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:54.960
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

00:06:54.984 --> 00:06:56.584
Yo, let's see your hits.

00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:58.612
That's you.

00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:23.012
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

00:07:24.722 --> 00:07:26.974
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.852
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:32.980
<i>It's a warning.</i>

00:07:34.773 --> 00:07:35.774
<i>To them.</i>

00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:46.702
<i>Fear...</i>

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:51.832
<i>Is a tool.</i>

00:08:02.927 --> 00:08:06.096
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drop head!

00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:20.486
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

00:08:23.447 --> 00:08:24.448
Come on!

00:08:32.872 --> 00:08:34.791
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.720
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:57.665
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

00:08:57.689 --> 00:08:59.148
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

00:09:00.108 --> 00:09:01.359
Help!

00:09:01.442 --> 00:09:02.652
Somebody help me!

00:09:03.444 --> 00:09:05.446
Help, help!

00:09:12.328 --> 00:09:13.722
Where you goin', huh?

00:09:18.334 --> 00:09:19.334
Come on.

00:09:19.377 --> 00:09:21.045
Come on, man. Break it.

00:09:23.214 --> 00:09:24.632
You can't move, huh?

00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:26.718
Now knock his ass out.

00:09:26.801 --> 00:09:28.511
Showtime. Showtime, man.

00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:30.138
Come on, man.

00:09:30.221 --> 00:09:31.472
Come on. Do it, man.

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:08.426
You see this guy?

00:10:15.642 --> 00:10:17.268
The hell are you supposed to be?

00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:35.578
I'm vengeance.

00:10:36.704 --> 00:10:38.623
Holy shit. It's him.

00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:05.441
Hey, man. No, no, no!

00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:48.568
Please don't hurt me.

00:12:24.604 --> 00:12:26.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:28.983
Police action.

00:12:29.567 --> 00:12:31.236
He's with me, Officer.

00:12:33.488 --> 00:12:35.073
Are you kidding me, sir?

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.742
You're gonna let him in here?

00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:41.204
Martinez, let him through.

00:12:54.842 --> 00:12:56.594
Goddamn freak.

00:13:12.484 --> 00:13:13.569
What do we know?

00:13:24.413 --> 00:13:25.789
Detective?

00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:27.499
Sorry, Lieutenant.

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:32.880
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.800
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.597
All this blood is from his head?

00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.056
No.

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:48.604
Excuse me.

00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:52.774
Most of it's from his hand.

00:13:58.238 --> 00:13:59.281
Thumb was severed.

00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:03.118
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

00:14:03.493 --> 00:14:05.412
He was alive when it was cut off.

00:14:06.705 --> 00:14:08.123
Ecchymosis...

00:14:09.374 --> 00:14:10.918
around the wound.

00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:27.851
Security detail downstairs

00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:30.145
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:33.857
The mayor was up here alone.

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.987
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:47.162
You said there was a card.

00:14:47.246 --> 00:14:48.830
Yeah.

00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:02.010
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:05.013
Haven't a clue?

00:15:05.097 --> 00:15:07.474
Let's play a game, just me and you.

00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:11.061
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

00:15:12.396 --> 00:15:14.481
There's a cipher too.

00:15:21.238 --> 00:15:23.115
Any of this mean anything to you?

00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:26.868
What's going on here?

00:15:29.955 --> 00:15:31.373
I asked him to come, Pete.

00:15:31.456 --> 00:15:33.125
This is a crime scene.

00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:35.544
It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!

00:15:35.627 --> 00:15:37.629
I got the press downstairs.

00:15:37.713 --> 00:15:40.465
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:42.384
But this is way over the line.

00:15:46.054 --> 00:15:47.139
Wait.

00:15:47.222 --> 00:15:48.992
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:50.142
How do you know?

00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:53.228
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

00:15:53.312 --> 00:15:55.123
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

00:15:55.147 --> 00:15:56.833
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

00:15:56.857 --> 00:15:58.400
He lies still.

00:15:59.902 --> 00:16:00.903
Excuse me?

00:16:02.446 --> 00:16:03.530
The riddle.

00:16:04.114 --> 00:16:07.534
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

00:16:16.668 --> 00:16:18.170
Oh, Jesus.

00:16:21.423 --> 00:16:24.218
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:27.054
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

00:16:27.846 --> 00:16:29.473
Excuse me, Commissioner.

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:32.226
They're ready for your statement.

00:16:36.271 --> 00:16:37.981
I want him outta here.

00:16:38.607 --> 00:16:39.691
Now!

00:16:46.281 --> 00:16:47.491
Come on.

00:17:00.295 --> 00:17:01.505
Yeah.

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:04.174
The kid found him.

00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:12.182
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

00:17:28.615 --> 00:17:30.784
We really gotta go, man.

00:17:36.373 --> 00:17:40.085
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

00:17:40.544 --> 00:17:42.379
A wife lost a husband.

00:17:43.589 --> 00:17:45.132
And I lost a friend.

00:17:46.216 --> 00:17:48.759
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

00:17:48.843 --> 00:17:51.929
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

00:17:52.388 --> 00:17:54.557
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:58.728
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:02.899
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:04.233
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:07.153
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

00:18:07.236 --> 00:18:08.821
<i>but I don't know.</i>

00:18:14.744 --> 00:18:17.622
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:19.790
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:21.876
<i>And now this.</i>

00:18:24.045 --> 00:18:25.630
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:29.592
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.971
<i>But I have to try.</i>

00:18:34.764 --> 00:18:36.015
<i>Push myself.</i>

00:19:22.103 --> 00:19:24.605
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:27.483
<i>behind the mask.</i>

00:19:31.988 --> 00:19:34.282
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

00:19:36.075 --> 00:19:38.244
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:42.206
<i>everything that happened.</i>

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:58.407
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:02.310
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:20:02.393 --> 00:20:05.229
<i>Was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

00:20:05.313 --> 00:20:07.064
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

00:20:07.148 --> 00:20:08.816
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.401
<i>still have not been released,</i>

00:20:10.484 --> 00:20:13.362
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:16.699
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

00:20:16.824 --> 00:20:18.618
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

00:20:18.701 --> 00:20:21.245
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:25.583
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

00:20:25.666 --> 00:20:27.418
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

00:20:27.501 --> 00:20:29.462
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

00:20:29.545 --> 00:20:32.381
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

00:20:32.465 --> 00:20:36.302
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

00:20:36.385 --> 00:20:38.179
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

00:20:38.262 --> 00:20:40.932
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

00:20:41.015 --> 00:20:44.268
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

00:20:44.352 --> 00:20:48.314
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

00:20:48.397 --> 00:20:52.568
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

00:20:52.652 --> 00:20:54.070
I assume you heard about this.

00:20:55.947 --> 00:20:57.227
Yeah.

00:21:04.205 --> 00:21:05.539
Oh, I see.

00:21:06.374 --> 00:21:08.334
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.044
Dear God.

00:21:18.803 --> 00:21:20.846
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

00:21:28.854 --> 00:21:31.148
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

00:21:34.318 --> 00:21:36.112
The killer left this for the Batman?

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.198
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

00:21:39.282 --> 00:21:40.283
Apparently.

00:21:40.575 --> 00:21:42.451
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

00:21:44.495 --> 00:21:45.830
Why is he writing to you?

00:21:45.913 --> 00:21:47.391
<i>It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!</i>

00:21:47.415 --> 00:21:48.457
I don't know yet.

00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:50.084
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

00:21:51.961 --> 00:21:53.379
Have a shower.

00:21:54.839 --> 00:21:56.519
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

00:21:56.591 --> 00:21:57.508
are coming for breakfast.

00:21:57.592 --> 00:21:59.594
Here? Why?

00:21:59.677 --> 00:22:00.821
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

00:22:00.845 --> 00:22:01.965
I haven't got time for this.

00:22:02.013 --> 00:22:03.681
It's getting serious, Bruce.

00:22:03.764 --> 00:22:06.851
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

00:22:06.934 --> 00:22:08.519
I don't care about that.

00:22:09.437 --> 00:22:10.313
Any of that.

00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:12.036
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

00:22:14.275 --> 00:22:17.403
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

00:22:17.486 --> 00:22:19.655
If I can't change things here,

00:22:20.197 --> 00:22:22.116
if I can't have an effect,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.827
then I don't care what happens to me.

00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:26.037
That's what I'm afraid of.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.746
Alfred, stop.

00:22:29.122 --> 00:22:30.582
You're not my father.

00:22:33.376 --> 00:22:34.794
I'm well aware.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.373
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

00:23:37.023 --> 00:23:38.608
Some fresh berries there.

00:23:45.782 --> 00:23:46.908
What are you doing?

00:23:47.284 --> 00:23:50.954
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:55.250
This is actually quite elusive.

00:23:58.253 --> 00:23:59.921
Where'd you get those O's?

00:24:01.464 --> 00:24:04.259
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:06.761
It only gives us H, E, I, I, S, and T.

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:10.891
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

00:24:10.974 --> 00:24:12.350
see where it leads.

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:15.270
That's interesting.

00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:17.647
Mr. Pennyworth?

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:19.024
Yes, Dory?

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:20.817
The accountants are here.

00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:22.736
See them in, please, Dory.

00:24:25.655 --> 00:24:27.866
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

00:24:27.949 --> 00:24:29.534
What do you mean?

00:24:29.618 --> 00:24:31.453
What if this is the whole key?

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.915
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

00:24:34.998 --> 00:24:37.101
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

00:24:37.125 --> 00:24:38.293
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:40.503
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

00:24:40.587 --> 00:24:42.422
I don't see how that's gonna...

00:24:44.966 --> 00:24:45.967
Oh.

00:24:59.773 --> 00:25:01.441
Damn.

00:25:01.608 --> 00:25:03.860
Yeah, he's got a car.

00:25:04.778 --> 00:25:07.155
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:08.907
Where to even start?

00:25:09.491 --> 00:25:11.826
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.030
You don't trust me?

00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:15.538
You mean like you trust me?

00:25:15.622 --> 00:25:18.500
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

00:25:20.502 --> 00:25:21.628
There.

00:25:44.734 --> 00:25:46.027
What are we looking for?

00:25:46.653 --> 00:25:48.196
A USB port.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.406
USB?

00:25:56.496 --> 00:25:57.664
What?

00:26:03.044 --> 00:26:05.297
"Thumb" drive.

00:26:06.089 --> 00:26:07.716
Jesus.

00:26:11.344 --> 00:26:12.846
It's encrypted.

00:26:16.266 --> 00:26:17.559
Try this.

00:26:24.566 --> 00:26:26.943
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:38.413
Oh, well, well, well.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.082
So much for family values.

00:26:41.249 --> 00:26:42.417
Who is she?

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.085
No idea.

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:47.839
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:49.973
I know who he is.

00:26:50.133 --> 00:26:51.134
What was that?

00:26:52.886 --> 00:26:55.722
Shit, shit! The drive.

00:26:56.473 --> 00:26:58.808
It sent out the photos from my account.

00:26:58.892 --> 00:27:01.436
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:03.605
Jesus.

00:27:03.688 --> 00:27:06.066
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:07.609
"He lies still."

00:27:07.817 --> 00:27:08.859
About her?

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.695
Maybe.

00:27:11.862 --> 00:27:13.739
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

00:27:13.822 --> 00:27:17.243
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

00:27:17.326 --> 00:27:19.453
Never get in there without a warrant.

00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:22.873
Yeah.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.179
Know who I am?

00:27:38.514 --> 00:27:40.766
Yeah. I got an idea.

00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:42.643
I want to see the Penguin.

00:27:43.352 --> 00:27:45.604
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:51.986
What's the problem?

00:27:52.069 --> 00:27:53.487
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:55.739
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

00:27:55.823 --> 00:27:57.449
That's what I tried to tell him.

00:27:57.533 --> 00:27:59.827
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.870
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

00:28:03.163 --> 00:28:04.248
Mine or yours?

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.590
Get him!

00:28:13.632 --> 00:28:14.860
I saw that whole thing.

00:28:14.884 --> 00:28:16.093
He's over there!

00:28:16.176 --> 00:28:17.511
What is your problem?

00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:02.348
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

00:29:12.942 --> 00:29:14.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:29:14.485 --> 00:29:16.612
Take it easy, sweetheart.

00:29:16.695 --> 00:29:18.489
You looking for me?

00:29:19.198 --> 00:29:21.116
I see you met the twins.

00:29:22.076 --> 00:29:25.371
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

00:29:26.247 --> 00:29:27.748
I guess we both are.

00:29:29.792 --> 00:29:31.210
How you doing?

00:29:31.835 --> 00:29:33.254
I'm Oz.

00:29:38.801 --> 00:29:40.052
Who is she?

00:29:43.097 --> 00:29:45.015
I really don't know, chief.

00:29:45.724 --> 00:29:47.935
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

00:29:48.018 --> 00:29:49.395
but I wasn't rolling with them.

00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:03.826
It's okay, baby.

00:30:04.368 --> 00:30:08.163
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:35.107
Thank you, honey.

00:30:41.614 --> 00:30:43.449
Here you go, champ.

00:30:43.532 --> 00:30:47.077
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

00:30:47.161 --> 00:30:48.954
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

00:30:49.455 --> 00:30:50.831
Is that the mayor?

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.708
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:55.211
Don't make me hurt you.

00:30:55.294 --> 00:30:59.465
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

00:30:59.548 --> 00:31:02.509
Yeah, I do. Do you?

00:31:04.261 --> 00:31:05.763
Look...

00:31:07.014 --> 00:31:09.808
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

00:31:10.643 --> 00:31:14.939
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.865
Tell you one thing.

00:31:27.034 --> 00:31:30.621
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:33.624
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

00:31:36.877 --> 00:31:38.712
What? Too soon?

00:31:48.555 --> 00:31:50.932
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

00:32:00.233 --> 00:32:01.234
Taxi!

00:32:03.736 --> 00:32:04.737
Taxi!

00:32:23.506 --> 00:32:24.799
Hey, it's me.

00:32:26.092 --> 00:32:27.427
Baby, what's wrong?

00:32:28.094 --> 00:32:30.096
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

00:32:32.557 --> 00:32:33.975
On the news?

00:32:34.642 --> 00:32:37.937
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

00:32:38.021 --> 00:32:39.731
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

00:32:40.899 --> 00:32:44.527
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:47.864
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

00:32:48.781 --> 00:32:50.221
Uh...

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.494
God damn it.

00:33:13.473 --> 00:33:15.534
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:33:15.558 --> 00:33:17.435
<i>With a younger mystery woman.</i>

00:33:17.518 --> 00:33:20.355
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

00:33:53.805 --> 00:33:56.724
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

00:36:11.234 --> 00:36:12.674
You're pretty good at that.

00:36:44.099 --> 00:36:46.310
Hey! Give me that.

00:36:49.938 --> 00:36:52.482
"Kosolov, Annika."

00:36:53.984 --> 00:36:56.069
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

00:36:56.153 --> 00:36:58.906
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

00:37:36.985 --> 00:37:39.613
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

00:37:39.696 --> 00:37:42.157
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

00:37:42.241 --> 00:37:43.676
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.452
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

00:37:45.535 --> 00:37:46.912
What does she know?

00:37:46.995 --> 00:37:49.182
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

00:37:49.206 --> 00:37:50.791
She did seem upset.

00:37:52.584 --> 00:37:54.086
Back at your place.

00:37:56.129 --> 00:37:57.631
Let's go talk to her.

00:38:23.824 --> 00:38:24.908
Anni!

00:38:26.201 --> 00:38:27.286

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:29.955
Anni!

00:38:34.001 --> 00:38:35.252
Anni!

00:38:51.268 --> 00:38:54.104
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

00:38:55.981 --> 00:38:57.733
Shit, they took my phone.

00:40:30.742 --> 00:40:32.661
The real club.

00:40:34.955 --> 00:40:36.707
It's a mob hangout.

00:40:37.165 --> 00:40:38.584

00:40:54.182 --> 00:40:55.392
Who?

00:40:55.976 --> 00:40:58.395
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.649
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

00:41:04.902 --> 00:41:06.445
You're gonna help me on this.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.571
For your friend.

00:41:19.165 --> 00:41:20.499
You got a lot of cats.

00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:23.920
I have a thing about strays.

00:41:28.049 --> 00:41:29.383
You're not safe here.

00:41:30.509 --> 00:41:31.677
I can take care of myself.

00:41:31.761 --> 00:41:34.555
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:36.182
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:39.518
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

00:41:39.602 --> 00:41:42.438
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

00:42:00.456 --> 00:42:03.626
He waited for him at the gym.

00:42:04.752 --> 00:42:06.796
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:09.006
when no one else was around.

00:42:10.132 --> 00:42:11.551
There's a needle mark on his neck.

00:42:11.634 --> 00:42:13.594
Injected him with arsenic.

00:42:15.596 --> 00:42:16.931
Rat poison.

00:42:17.723 --> 00:42:19.308
Yeah.

00:42:19.475 --> 00:42:21.936
That seems to be his theme here.

00:42:22.478 --> 00:42:23.854
Look at this thing.

00:42:31.988 --> 00:42:33.739
It's a maze.

00:42:36.325 --> 00:42:39.620
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

00:42:42.373 --> 00:42:43.457
More symbols.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.545
It's another cipher.

00:42:47.628 --> 00:42:50.381
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

00:42:51.048 --> 00:42:53.634
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

00:42:53.718 --> 00:42:56.846
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

00:42:58.431 --> 00:42:59.765
I don't get it.

00:42:59.849 --> 00:43:02.226
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

00:43:03.144 --> 00:43:05.146
Looks like he got greedy.

00:43:05.229 --> 00:43:06.272
You kidding me?

00:43:06.355 --> 00:43:09.066
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.403
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

00:43:12.486 --> 00:43:14.697
Maybe he's not who you thought.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.284
You make it sound like he had it coming.

00:43:20.536 --> 00:43:21.996
He was a cop.

00:43:23.331 --> 00:43:24.624
Crossed a line.

00:43:55.863 --> 00:43:57.531
"I'm mad about you.

00:43:57.615 --> 00:44:01.285
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

00:44:08.417 --> 00:44:11.504
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:15.258
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

00:44:15.341 --> 00:44:17.051
The hell is that?

00:44:17.802 --> 00:44:20.972
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

00:44:22.098 --> 00:44:23.599
I don't know.

00:44:24.475 --> 00:44:25.643
Lieutenant.

00:44:25.726 --> 00:44:27.144
They're coming back.

00:44:27.228 --> 00:44:28.628
We got to get out of here.

00:44:32.567 --> 00:44:33.776
Come on.

00:44:38.864 --> 00:44:39.907
Ow!

00:44:41.367 --> 00:44:42.702
I don't know about these things.

00:44:42.785 --> 00:44:46.247
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

00:44:50.251 --> 00:44:52.837
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

00:44:54.714 --> 00:44:56.173
I'm just looking for Annika.

00:45:00.469 --> 00:45:02.096
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

00:45:03.222 --> 00:45:05.850
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

00:45:15.401 --> 00:45:16.611
Look at me.

00:45:26.245 --> 00:45:28.414
Looks good. Here.

00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:13.583
I got you. Can you hear me?

00:46:14.543 --> 00:46:15.544
Yeah.

00:46:24.219 --> 00:46:25.220
Hey, where you goin'?

00:46:25.845 --> 00:46:26.972
Hospitality.

00:46:27.722 --> 00:46:30.559
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

00:46:32.352 --> 00:46:33.853
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

00:46:40.527 --> 00:46:42.612
"Kenzie, William."

00:46:42.696 --> 00:46:44.155
He's an off-duty cop.

00:46:46.032 --> 00:46:48.010
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

00:46:48.034 --> 00:46:50.078
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

00:47:06.636 --> 00:47:09.764
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

00:47:09.848 --> 00:47:10.974
Great.

00:47:18.231 --> 00:47:20.585
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

00:47:20.609 --> 00:47:22.193
Feels good, doesn't it?

00:47:22.277 --> 00:47:24.487
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

00:47:30.535 --> 00:47:32.162
<i>Jesus, I hate drop heads.</i>

00:47:32.245 --> 00:47:33.288
Really?

00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:34.390
'Cause when I first saw you,

00:47:34.414 --> 00:47:35.683
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

00:47:35.707 --> 00:47:37.959
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

00:47:38.585 --> 00:47:40.337
Can we not do this right now?

00:47:42.255 --> 00:47:43.798
Wait. Who was that?

00:47:43.882 --> 00:47:45.050
Oh, I saw him.

00:47:45.133 --> 00:47:46.218
<i>Look back.</i>

00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:48.154
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

00:47:48.178 --> 00:47:49.512
I need to see his face.

00:47:51.181 --> 00:47:52.641
Jesus.

00:48:00.649 --> 00:48:01.816
That's the DA.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:02.943
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

00:48:03.026 --> 00:48:04.694
And he's coming over. You happy?

00:48:04.778 --> 00:48:05.987
<i>Talk to him.</i>

00:48:09.115 --> 00:48:10.200
Hey. How you doing?

00:48:10.283 --> 00:48:11.368
Hi.

00:48:11.451 --> 00:48:12.451
I'm Gil.

00:48:13.495 --> 00:48:15.121
Hey, aren't you the DA?

00:48:15.205 --> 00:48:16.205
Yeah.

00:48:16.373 --> 00:48:18.542
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

00:48:18.625 --> 00:48:20.001
Is that right?

00:48:20.418 --> 00:48:22.629
I haven't seen you around here before.

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.674
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

00:48:25.757 --> 00:48:28.301
'cause people are all a little on edge.

00:48:28.385 --> 00:48:29.945
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:31.239
<i>Is that right?</i>

00:48:31.263 --> 00:48:32.472
<i>I like that.</i>

00:48:32.847 --> 00:48:33.890
Do you want to come over?

00:48:33.974 --> 00:48:35.100
Sure.

00:48:38.103 --> 00:48:39.437
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:41.081
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:43.108
<i>- Richie, Glen.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

00:48:44.568 --> 00:48:46.069
That's half the DA's office.

00:48:46.152 --> 00:48:47.380
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

00:48:47.404 --> 00:48:48.404
Hi.

00:48:48.446 --> 00:48:50.550
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

00:48:50.574 --> 00:48:52.450
Drowning our sorrows.

00:48:52.784 --> 00:48:54.077
<i>You want a drop?</i>

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.204
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

00:48:58.164 --> 00:48:59.833
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

00:48:59.916 --> 00:49:02.276
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

00:49:02.419 --> 00:49:03.419
He's wasted.

00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:04.504
No shit.

00:49:06.172 --> 00:49:07.292
<i>I like this girl.</i>

00:49:07.632 --> 00:49:09.217
Oh, hey, I like you too!

00:49:12.762 --> 00:49:16.099
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

00:49:16.182 --> 00:49:17.267
<i>He knows so much.</i>

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:18.703
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

00:49:18.727 --> 00:49:21.038
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

00:49:21.062 --> 00:49:21.980
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

00:49:22.063 --> 00:49:24.041
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

00:49:24.065 --> 00:49:26.026
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

00:49:28.028 --> 00:49:29.863
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

00:49:40.207 --> 00:49:41.416
<i>I mean...</i>

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:45.837
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

00:49:46.421 --> 00:49:48.840
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

00:49:48.924 --> 00:49:50.693
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

00:49:50.717 --> 00:49:52.302
He's talking about the Maroni case.

00:49:52.385 --> 00:49:55.680
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

00:49:56.264 --> 00:49:58.558
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

00:49:58.642 --> 00:50:00.560
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

00:50:00.644 --> 00:50:03.331
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

00:50:03.355 --> 00:50:04.606
What do you know about that?

00:50:06.233 --> 00:50:07.400
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

00:50:07.484 --> 00:50:08.484
<i>I want a drink.</i>

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:09.861
Keep him talking.

00:50:12.948 --> 00:50:14.032
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

00:50:14.115 --> 00:50:15.158
She knows Annika.

00:50:15.242 --> 00:50:16.660
No, stay on the DA.

00:50:16.743 --> 00:50:18.662
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:22.916
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

00:50:22.999 --> 00:50:24.101
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

00:50:24.125 --> 00:50:26.729
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

00:50:26.753 --> 00:50:28.004
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

00:50:28.088 --> 00:50:30.548
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

00:50:30.631 --> 00:50:33.551
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

00:50:33.634 --> 00:50:35.195
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:36.303
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

00:50:41.058 --> 00:50:42.101
<i>Hey.</i>

00:50:42.685 --> 00:50:43.769
Hey.

00:50:44.937 --> 00:50:48.107
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.609
How you been?

00:50:52.945 --> 00:50:54.655
Yeah, I've been okay.

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:57.366
<i>I was just...</i>

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.245
I was just headed back upstairs.

00:51:01.996 --> 00:51:02.997
Well...

00:51:04.081 --> 00:51:05.749
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

00:51:19.847 --> 00:51:22.224
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

00:51:22.308 --> 00:51:23.952
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

00:51:23.976 --> 00:51:25.769
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

00:51:25.853 --> 00:51:27.747
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

00:51:27.771 --> 00:51:28.856
Wait, what are you doing?

00:51:28.939 --> 00:51:31.358
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

00:51:35.946 --> 00:51:36.947
Taxi!

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:41.911
Hey!

00:51:43.621 --> 00:51:44.705
I lost you in there.

00:51:44.788 --> 00:51:45.873
Yeah, I gotta go.

00:51:46.749 --> 00:51:48.167
Oh, you need a ride?

00:51:48.876 --> 00:51:50.169
That's me right there.

00:51:56.258 --> 00:51:57.343
Taxi!

00:51:57.426 --> 00:51:58.552
I'm good.

00:52:00.262 --> 00:52:01.680
I hope, uh...

00:52:06.268 --> 00:52:07.686
I'll see you around.

00:53:34.356 --> 00:53:38.152
Just hold still.

00:54:36.502 --> 00:54:37.419
What do you know about

00:54:37.503 --> 00:54:39.797
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

00:54:42.883 --> 00:54:44.593
Yeah, sure, there was.

00:54:45.302 --> 00:54:47.137
That's the rat we're looking for.

00:54:48.055 --> 00:54:49.932
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

00:54:50.516 --> 00:54:53.519
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

00:54:53.602 --> 00:54:55.062
Where are you getting this?

00:54:55.145 --> 00:54:58.023
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

00:54:58.816 --> 00:55:00.276
Gil's very nervous.

00:55:01.235 --> 00:55:03.779
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

00:55:03.862 --> 00:55:05.739
I worked that case.

00:55:05.823 --> 00:55:07.783
Riddler's not after you.

00:55:07.866 --> 00:55:08.866
How do you know?

00:55:09.158 --> 00:55:10.577
You're not corrupt.

00:55:11.619 --> 00:55:13.162
Colson's dirty?

00:55:19.043 --> 00:55:20.545
Maybe I, uh...

00:55:21.212 --> 00:55:24.549
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

00:55:24.632 --> 00:55:27.927
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

00:55:28.678 --> 00:55:30.471
Who knows how many people it touches.

00:55:30.555 --> 00:55:33.766
Politicians. Police. The courts.

00:55:35.059 --> 00:55:36.769
It could tear the whole city apart.

00:55:37.186 --> 00:55:39.230
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

00:55:40.857 --> 00:55:42.609
And Riddler's the match.

00:55:43.484 --> 00:55:44.712
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

00:55:44.736 --> 00:55:46.088
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

00:55:46.112 --> 00:55:47.590
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:47.614 --> 00:55:49.174
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

00:55:50.158 --> 00:55:51.802
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:51.826 --> 00:55:53.596
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

00:55:54.621 --> 00:55:56.080
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

00:55:56.164 --> 00:55:57.266
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:58.976
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.895
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

00:56:00.919 --> 00:56:02.399
Pretty.

00:56:04.172 --> 00:56:05.548
She a new friend of yours?

00:56:10.136 --> 00:56:11.346
I'm not so sure.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.681
Looks like you upset her.

00:56:14.849 --> 00:56:16.976
Shall I take this as a good sign?

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.061
What?

00:56:18.144 --> 00:56:19.062
Your attire.

00:56:19.145 --> 00:56:21.272
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

00:56:21.356 --> 00:56:23.358
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

00:56:23.441 --> 00:56:26.110
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

00:56:27.153 --> 00:56:28.738
Riddler might not be able to resist.

00:56:28.821 --> 00:56:30.281
Oh, that reminds me.

00:56:31.449 --> 00:56:35.411
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

00:56:35.954 --> 00:56:37.455
The one from the rat maze.

00:56:37.872 --> 00:56:40.959
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

00:56:41.292 --> 00:56:43.169
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

00:56:43.253 --> 00:56:46.506
"You are <i>El Rata A lad a."</i>

00:56:47.131 --> 00:56:48.550
<i>Rata A lad a?</i>

00:56:48.633 --> 00:56:49.842
"Rat with wings"?

00:56:49.926 --> 00:56:52.428
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

00:56:52.512 --> 00:56:53.763
Yeah.

00:56:55.223 --> 00:56:56.349
A stool pigeon.

00:56:56.599 --> 00:56:58.226
Where are your cufflinks?

00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:59.309
I couldn't find them.

00:57:00.728 --> 00:57:02.689
Well, you can't go out like that.

00:57:02.772 --> 00:57:04.566
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

00:57:08.736 --> 00:57:11.531
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

00:57:13.241 --> 00:57:15.451
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

00:57:16.452 --> 00:57:18.246
Your father gave them to me.

00:57:24.002 --> 00:57:27.130
No more lies! No more lies!

00:57:45.315 --> 00:57:48.276
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:02.582
Is that Bruce Wayne?

00:58:02.665 --> 00:58:05.293
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

00:58:14.385 --> 00:58:15.386
Hold it.

00:58:16.721 --> 00:58:17.972
You good, fellas?

00:58:18.556 --> 00:58:19.557
Good.

00:58:21.684 --> 00:58:22.769
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

00:58:40.578 --> 00:58:41.579
Sir?

00:59:01.266 --> 00:59:02.266
Hey!

00:59:02.308 --> 00:59:04.310
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:07.105
Hey, watch it, fellas.

00:59:07.564 --> 00:59:09.857
You got the prince of the city there.

00:59:12.694 --> 00:59:14.529
Some event, huh?

00:59:14.612 --> 00:59:17.574
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

00:59:17.657 --> 00:59:20.118
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

00:59:20.201 --> 00:59:21.887
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

00:59:21.911 --> 00:59:23.913
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:26.207
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

00:59:26.833 --> 00:59:28.293
Wow. Is that right?

00:59:28.376 --> 00:59:30.420
His father saved my life.

00:59:31.379 --> 00:59:34.591
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.304
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

00:59:39.596 --> 00:59:42.807
Operated right on the dining room table.

00:59:42.891 --> 00:59:48.146
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

00:59:49.563 --> 00:59:51.565
I remember your face.

00:59:53.567 --> 00:59:55.527
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

00:59:55.903 --> 00:59:58.030
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

00:59:59.364 --> 01:00:00.949
"Hippocratic oath."

01:00:03.493 --> 01:00:04.703
That's good.

01:00:05.245 --> 01:00:06.413
Excuse me.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Yes.

01:00:25.015 --> 01:00:26.159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:00:26.183 --> 01:00:27.827
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

01:00:27.851 --> 01:00:30.229
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

01:00:30.312 --> 01:00:32.105
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

01:00:32.189 --> 01:00:33.629
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:35.168
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

01:00:35.192 --> 01:00:36.610
<i>consider a donation to</i>

01:00:36.693 --> 01:00:38.737
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.073
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

01:00:41.156 --> 01:00:42.366
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:45.285
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:50.123
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

01:00:50.207 --> 01:00:53.418
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

01:00:54.419 --> 01:00:56.296
He got what he deserved.

01:00:58.215 --> 01:00:59.216
Know what I mean?

01:01:00.509 --> 01:01:02.636
Hey, don't I know you?

01:01:02.719 --> 01:01:03.804
Bruce Wayne.

01:01:04.721 --> 01:01:06.682
Why haven't you called me back?

01:01:06.765 --> 01:01:07.766
I'm sorry?

01:01:08.058 --> 01:01:10.394
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

01:01:10.477 --> 01:01:11.746
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:14.439
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

01:01:14.523 --> 01:01:15.857
Will you walk with me?

01:01:21.029 --> 01:01:22.364
Mr. Wayne.

01:01:22.447 --> 01:01:23.657
Mr. Wayne.

01:01:24.366 --> 01:01:27.452
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

01:01:28.036 --> 01:01:29.872
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

01:01:29.955 --> 01:01:32.374
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

01:01:32.457 --> 01:01:34.918
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

01:01:35.502 --> 01:01:36.795
Thank you.

01:01:37.671 --> 01:01:38.672
My God.

01:01:40.507 --> 01:01:43.010
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

01:01:43.093 --> 01:01:44.720
I want to continue this.

01:01:48.932 --> 01:01:49.932
Excuse me.

01:01:51.852 --> 01:01:53.729
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:01:55.939 --> 01:01:56.857
Thank you.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.700
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

01:02:00.027 --> 01:02:01.904
Gil Colson is missing.

01:02:01.987 --> 01:02:03.280
What?

01:02:03.363 --> 01:02:05.657
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

01:02:05.741 --> 01:02:06.783
Christ, not again.

01:02:06.867 --> 01:02:08.952
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

01:02:11.246 --> 01:02:13.290
You got people looking for him, Jim?

01:02:13.957 --> 01:02:16.251
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

01:02:16.335 --> 01:02:17.252
What'd his wife say?

01:02:17.336 --> 01:02:18.736
She hadn't heard from him.

01:03:13.308 --> 01:03:14.428
Get out of the car!

01:03:14.977 --> 01:03:17.187
Get out of the car and show your hands!

01:03:18.605 --> 01:03:19.815
Get out!

01:03:30.325 --> 01:03:31.618
Get 'em up!

01:03:31.702 --> 01:03:33.453
Get out! Show 'em!

01:03:37.916 --> 01:03:39.501
Christ, it's Colson.

01:03:39.585 --> 01:03:41.295
There's a bomb around his neck!

01:03:56.351 --> 01:03:57.895
Let's clear this place out now!

01:03:57.978 --> 01:04:00.018
We've got to get this place cleared out!

01:04:33.846 --> 01:04:36.599
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

01:04:39.602 --> 01:04:41.202
We don't know if he's in on it.

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:45.483
What's he looking at?

01:05:04.252 --> 01:05:05.586
Holy shit.

01:05:06.629 --> 01:05:08.297
Are you kidding me?

01:05:08.381 --> 01:05:11.133
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

01:05:11.968 --> 01:05:14.428
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

01:05:30.194 --> 01:05:31.404
Please.

01:05:31.571 --> 01:05:34.323
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.010
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:38.035
I'm so sorry.

01:05:38.536 --> 01:05:40.204
Looks like a combination lock.

01:05:40.288 --> 01:05:41.747
Can't we just cut it off?

01:05:42.498 --> 01:05:44.166
Not if you want to keep your head.

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.121
<i>You came.</i>

01:06:23.956 --> 01:06:25.041
Who are you?

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:26.584
<i>Me?</i>

01:06:29.003 --> 01:06:30.588
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

01:06:32.048 --> 01:06:34.467
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:38.846
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

01:06:39.388 --> 01:06:40.473
"Unmask"?

01:06:40.556 --> 01:06:41.724
<i>Yes.</i>

01:06:42.558 --> 01:06:45.394
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

01:06:45.478 --> 01:06:47.897
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

01:06:48.564 --> 01:06:50.900
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

01:06:50.983 --> 01:06:52.777
How am I a part of this?

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.779
<i>You'll see.</i>

01:06:54.862 --> 01:06:56.673
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

01:06:56.697 --> 01:06:58.783
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

01:06:58.866 --> 01:07:00.117
<i>We're live.</i>

01:07:00.201 --> 01:07:03.204
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

01:07:04.413 --> 01:07:05.581
<i>At the moment,</i>

01:07:05.665 --> 01:07:09.043
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:10.169
<i>is dead.</i>

01:07:10.253 --> 01:07:12.314
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

01:07:12.338 --> 01:07:13.338
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

01:07:13.381 --> 01:07:16.509
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

01:07:16.592 --> 01:07:19.595
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:07:19.679 --> 01:07:20.680
Okay.

01:07:29.438 --> 01:07:31.524
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

01:07:33.276 --> 01:07:35.444
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:38.531
<i>Now,</i>

01:07:39.532 --> 01:07:42.326
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:45.997
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

01:07:46.581 --> 01:07:49.000
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

01:07:49.083 --> 01:07:52.420
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

01:07:52.503 --> 01:07:57.717
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.052
You want me to do puzzles?

01:08:00.136 --> 01:08:02.889
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

01:08:02.972 --> 01:08:07.059
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

01:08:07.143 --> 01:08:09.478
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

01:08:09.562 --> 01:08:11.731
Okay, okay. So I just...

01:08:11.814 --> 01:08:13.000
You want me to...

01:08:13.024 --> 01:08:15.359
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

01:08:15.443 --> 01:08:19.071
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

01:08:19.155 --> 01:08:23.826
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:26.329
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

01:08:26.412 --> 01:08:27.496
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.998
- "Justice."
- Huh?

01:08:29.081 --> 01:08:30.124
The answer's "justice."

01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:31.417
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.085
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:37.506
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:39.967
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

01:08:40.051 --> 01:08:42.428
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

01:08:42.511 --> 01:08:43.780
Of course, of course. Of course.

01:08:43.804 --> 01:08:46.182
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

01:08:46.265 --> 01:08:50.394
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

01:08:50.478 --> 01:08:54.649
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

01:08:54.732 --> 01:08:56.525
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

01:08:56.609 --> 01:08:57.860
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

01:08:57.944 --> 01:09:00.172
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:02.716
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:03.991
- How much?
- Nothing!

01:09:04.075 --> 01:09:06.285
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

01:09:06.369 --> 01:09:08.722
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

01:09:08.746 --> 01:09:09.580
What cases?

01:09:09.664 --> 01:09:10.789
He didn't ask me that!

01:09:10.872 --> 01:09:12.308
Come on! Ten grand.

01:09:12.332 --> 01:09:15.293
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

01:09:15.377 --> 01:09:18.004
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

01:09:18.088 --> 01:09:21.925
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

01:09:22.008 --> 01:09:24.427
<i>Last riddle.</i>

01:09:24.511 --> 01:09:28.848
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:33.228
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

01:09:33.311 --> 01:09:35.397
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.024
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

01:09:38.108 --> 01:09:39.961
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

01:09:39.985 --> 01:09:41.194
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:42.946
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:45.049
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

01:09:45.073 --> 01:09:46.616
If I go out this way, it's just me.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.828
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

01:09:49.911 --> 01:09:51.371
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

01:09:51.454 --> 01:09:52.849
- People are watching.
- What people?

01:09:52.873 --> 01:09:55.000
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:57.252
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

01:09:57.335 --> 01:09:58.211
<i>Four!</i>

01:09:58.295 --> 01:09:59.730
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

01:09:59.754 --> 01:10:01.631
<i>Goodbye!</i>

01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:33.264
Who do you think he is under there?

01:10:33.288 --> 01:10:34.122
Take it easy.

01:10:34.206 --> 01:10:35.207
I want to see.

01:10:36.541 --> 01:10:37.981
What is that thing? Leather?

01:10:41.504 --> 01:10:42.964
What's he got on his eyes?

01:10:43.048 --> 01:10:44.567
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

01:10:44.591 --> 01:10:45.860
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

01:10:45.884 --> 01:10:47.364
Hey!

01:10:47.636 --> 01:10:50.764
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:52.515
Relax, God damn it!

01:10:52.599 --> 01:10:54.100
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:58.063
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

01:10:58.146 --> 01:11:00.565
Colson's blood is on his hands.

01:11:00.649 --> 01:11:02.067
Maybe it's on yours.

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:04.569
What'd you say?

01:11:04.653 --> 01:11:06.238
He would rather die than talk.

01:11:06.821 --> 01:11:08.323
What was he afraid of?

01:11:09.074 --> 01:11:10.158
You?

01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:18.708
You son of a bitch.

01:11:19.292 --> 01:11:22.295
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

01:11:22.379 --> 01:11:24.089
You could be an accessory to murder.

01:11:24.172 --> 01:11:25.274
Why are we playing games...

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.176
Get him! Come on!

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:30.262
Back off! Back off!

01:11:30.345 --> 01:11:32.639
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:34.808
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:37.686
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

01:11:40.355 --> 01:11:41.898
You too now?

01:11:41.982 --> 01:11:44.526
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

01:11:44.609 --> 01:11:47.195
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

01:11:47.279 --> 01:11:49.531
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

01:11:52.325 --> 01:11:53.827
Okay, give him the room.

01:12:09.467 --> 01:12:10.760
Two minutes.

01:12:22.522 --> 01:12:24.107
You listen to me.

01:12:25.692 --> 01:12:27.694
We gotta get you out of here.

01:12:29.362 --> 01:12:31.323
That would put a lot of heat on you.

01:12:31.406 --> 01:12:33.074
Well, you punched me in the face.

01:12:35.327 --> 01:12:36.620
Take this key.

01:12:37.913 --> 01:12:41.291
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

01:12:42.334 --> 01:12:44.094
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

01:12:45.045 --> 01:12:47.339
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

01:12:50.717 --> 01:12:53.094
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

01:12:56.514 --> 01:12:59.226
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

01:12:59.309 --> 01:13:02.229
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.774
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:10.445
Or he moonlights as a cop.

01:13:15.033 --> 01:13:16.593
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

01:13:16.618 --> 01:13:18.119
Somebody stop him!

01:13:56.323 --> 01:13:58.203
- There he is!
- Freeze!

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.286
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

01:14:46.707 --> 01:14:47.917
I did.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.378
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

01:14:51.462 --> 01:14:53.505
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:54.715
I only trust you.

01:14:54.798 --> 01:14:57.134
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

01:14:57.218 --> 01:15:00.596
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

01:15:01.347 --> 01:15:02.473
You think Penguin's the rat?

01:15:02.556 --> 01:15:05.601
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

01:15:05.684 --> 01:15:07.645
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

01:15:07.728 --> 01:15:09.063
DA was a regular too.

01:15:09.146 --> 01:15:12.650
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

01:15:13.734 --> 01:15:14.944
The <i>Rata A lad a.</i>

01:15:15.027 --> 01:15:16.027
The what?

01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:17.529
Riddler's latest.

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.323
The cipher in the maze.

01:15:19.406 --> 01:15:21.909
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

01:15:23.494 --> 01:15:25.120
A penguin's got wings too.

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:29.083
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:30.894
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

01:15:30.918 --> 01:15:34.129
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

01:15:34.213 --> 01:15:37.383
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:42.210
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

01:15:43.013 --> 01:15:44.098
There's Penguin.

01:15:44.181 --> 01:15:46.058
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

01:15:47.685 --> 01:15:48.936
<i>You want to move in?</i>

01:15:50.813 --> 01:15:52.273
<i>Let's follow.</i>

01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:14.336
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

01:16:14.461 --> 01:16:15.713
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:16:17.131 --> 01:16:18.859
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

01:16:18.883 --> 01:16:21.385
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

01:16:40.613 --> 01:16:43.157
It's a drug lab. Drops.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.450
This is a buy.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:47.703
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

01:16:47.786 --> 01:16:49.014
Or they never shut it down at all.

01:16:49.038 --> 01:16:49.914
<i>What are you saying?</i>

01:16:49.997 --> 01:16:53.125
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

01:17:17.483 --> 01:17:18.901
This just got complicated.

01:17:19.652 --> 01:17:20.819
What do you mean?

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:28.202
Hey! What happened?

01:17:28.285 --> 01:17:29.620
You all right?

01:17:40.339 --> 01:17:42.132
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:43.884
Jesus.

01:17:44.635 --> 01:17:46.470
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

01:17:46.971 --> 01:17:48.305
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

01:17:48.389 --> 01:17:50.099
Is that why you work in the club?

01:17:50.849 --> 01:17:51.892
It was all just a score?

01:17:51.976 --> 01:17:55.771
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

01:17:57.147 --> 01:17:59.066
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

01:18:10.369 --> 01:18:11.369
Jesus!

01:18:39.939 --> 01:18:41.065
Hey, Vengeance!

01:18:43.234 --> 01:18:45.945
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

01:19:26.819 --> 01:19:28.446
Kenzie! Get the money!

01:19:33.868 --> 01:19:35.119
Hey! What the...

01:20:25.753 --> 01:20:27.088
Whoa!

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:31.885
Come on! Come on!

01:20:35.054 --> 01:20:36.389
This guy's crazy!

01:20:38.141 --> 01:20:39.851
Come on! Hey!

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:30.318
Move!

01:22:35.133 --> 01:22:37.010
Get out of the way!

01:22:48.146 --> 01:22:49.230
Come on!

01:22:57.947 --> 01:22:59.073
Get out of the way!

01:23:36.318 --> 01:23:38.362
I got you!

01:23:39.613 --> 01:23:40.948
I got you!

01:23:41.031 --> 01:23:43.367
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:44.910
I got you!

01:25:01.361 --> 01:25:04.198
What the hell is this?
Good cop, bat shit cop?

01:25:04.281 --> 01:25:06.909
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

01:25:06.992 --> 01:25:08.344
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

01:25:08.368 --> 01:25:09.786
Cops caught you doing something.

01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:11.556
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.457
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.667
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

01:25:15.751 --> 01:25:16.960
His drops operation.

01:25:17.044 --> 01:25:19.504
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

01:25:19.588 --> 01:25:23.217
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:25.111
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

01:25:25.135 --> 01:25:27.471
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

01:25:27.554 --> 01:25:30.766
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

01:25:30.849 --> 01:25:32.017
What are you, crazy?

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.244
That why you killed the girl?

01:25:33.268 --> 01:25:34.268
I didn't kill no girl!

01:25:34.311 --> 01:25:36.104
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

01:25:36.188 --> 01:25:37.481
But she got too close, right?

01:25:37.564 --> 01:25:39.834
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

01:25:39.858 --> 01:25:41.818
But somehow Riddler found out too.

01:25:41.902 --> 01:25:43.820
He knows so much about you.

01:25:43.904 --> 01:25:45.948
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

01:25:46.532 --> 01:25:48.742
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

01:25:49.159 --> 01:25:50.439
Why don't you start harmonizing?

01:25:50.661 --> 01:25:53.330
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

01:25:53.413 --> 01:25:54.748
I ain't no rat!

01:25:54.831 --> 01:25:56.726
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:57.894
if he heard this kind of talk?

01:25:57.918 --> 01:26:00.087
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:02.714
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

01:26:02.798 --> 01:26:04.358
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

01:26:04.424 --> 01:26:06.051
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

01:26:06.134 --> 01:26:08.053
Open your eyes!

01:26:11.974 --> 01:26:13.559
Are you <i>El Rata A lad a?</i>

01:26:13.642 --> 01:26:15.143
<i>El Rata A lad a?</i>

01:26:15.227 --> 01:26:17.062
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

01:26:17.145 --> 01:26:19.481
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

01:26:19.565 --> 01:26:22.150
It says you are <i>El Rata A lad a.</i>

01:26:22.234 --> 01:26:23.610
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

01:26:23.694 --> 01:26:24.963
Why, you got something to tell us?

01:26:24.987 --> 01:26:25.987
Yeah!

01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:27.632
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

01:26:27.656 --> 01:26:28.656
What?

01:26:28.907 --> 01:26:30.242
It's <i>"La."</i>

01:26:30.325 --> 01:26:31.618
<i>"La" rata.</i>

01:26:32.119 --> 01:26:34.121
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

01:26:34.204 --> 01:26:36.081
Jesus! Look at you two.

01:26:36.498 --> 01:26:38.750
World's greatest detectives!

01:26:39.167 --> 01:26:41.521
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

01:26:41.545 --> 01:26:42.629
Jesus!

01:26:42.713 --> 01:26:44.214
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

01:26:44.298 --> 01:26:46.300
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

01:26:47.718 --> 01:26:48.838
You think he made a mistake?

01:26:48.886 --> 01:26:50.095
He doesn't make mistakes.

01:26:50.178 --> 01:26:51.221
A rat with wings?

01:26:51.305 --> 01:26:52.890
You know what that sounds like to me?

01:26:52.973 --> 01:26:56.143
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

01:26:56.226 --> 01:26:58.228
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

01:27:03.859 --> 01:27:07.738
"You are <i>el."</i>

01:27:16.413 --> 01:27:17.915
Maybe it was a mistake.

01:27:18.332 --> 01:27:19.166
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

01:27:19.249 --> 01:27:20.249
Wait.

01:27:23.503 --> 01:27:24.838
Is that him?

01:27:25.714 --> 01:27:27.549
Holy shit.

01:27:47.444 --> 01:27:49.324
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

01:28:18.432 --> 01:28:22.061
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

01:28:22.144 --> 01:28:24.981
But in a mansion, in a slum,

01:28:25.064 --> 01:28:26.983
I'll never know where I come from.

01:28:27.858 --> 01:28:29.193
Do you know what I am?"

01:28:29.277 --> 01:28:30.278
Any idea?

01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:31.821
Yeah.

01:28:33.239 --> 01:28:34.490
It's an orphan.

01:28:43.374 --> 01:28:45.126
A mansion in a slum.

01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:49.309
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

01:28:49.338 --> 01:28:51.048
It was part of the Wayne estate.

01:28:51.674 --> 01:28:53.318
They donated it
after they built the tower.

01:28:53.342 --> 01:28:54.342
Let's go.

01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:59.891
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

01:29:00.933 --> 01:29:02.310
You gonna untie me?

01:29:02.393 --> 01:29:04.193
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

01:29:07.773 --> 01:29:08.774
Hey!

01:29:10.234 --> 01:29:12.653
You goddamn sons of bitches!

01:29:26.751 --> 01:29:28.920
No guns.

01:29:30.379 --> 01:29:32.423
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

01:29:53.528 --> 01:29:54.737
What's that?

01:30:05.248 --> 01:30:07.166
Hey! Hey!

01:30:13.631 --> 01:30:14.840
Drop heads.

01:30:22.265 --> 01:30:23.891
What the hell is that?

01:30:35.653 --> 01:30:38.030
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

01:30:38.114 --> 01:30:39.407
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

01:30:42.159 --> 01:30:44.203
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.205
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

01:30:47.957 --> 01:30:49.542
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

01:30:50.835 --> 01:30:52.628
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

01:30:53.838 --> 01:30:57.300
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

01:30:57.842 --> 01:30:59.635
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

01:30:59.719 --> 01:31:02.555
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

01:31:02.638 --> 01:31:05.975
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

01:31:06.517 --> 01:31:08.394
<i>Win or lose,</i>

01:31:08.477 --> 01:31:11.272
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

01:31:11.731 --> 01:31:14.567
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

01:31:15.151 --> 01:31:19.197
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.199
<i>who need it now,</i>

01:31:21.282 --> 01:31:22.742
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

01:31:22.825 --> 01:31:24.243
"Sins of the father."

01:31:24.327 --> 01:31:26.787
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

01:31:29.248 --> 01:31:31.334
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

01:31:35.213 --> 01:31:37.423
Shall be visited upon the son.

01:31:39.425 --> 01:31:42.553
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

01:31:47.141 --> 01:31:48.559
Hey!

01:32:48.243 --> 01:32:50.787
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

01:32:50.871 --> 01:32:52.706
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

01:32:52.789 --> 01:32:54.416
Something terrible is gonna happen!

01:32:55.083 --> 01:32:57.168
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

01:33:08.972 --> 01:33:10.724
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

01:33:11.892 --> 01:33:13.560
I'm so sorry.

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:16.771
I've been trying to reach you.

01:33:19.524 --> 01:33:21.284
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

01:33:21.735 --> 01:33:25.488
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.846
We've sedated him.

01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:51.556
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

01:33:52.432 --> 01:33:55.143
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

01:33:55.685 --> 01:33:57.437
Is there anyone else to notify?

01:33:58.772 --> 01:34:00.190
Next of kin?

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.404
No.

01:34:07.531 --> 01:34:09.157
It's just me.

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:53.511
Selina?

01:36:00.143 --> 01:36:01.144
<i>Can you see me?</i>

01:36:04.272 --> 01:36:06.691
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

01:36:07.567 --> 01:36:08.652
<i>Where can we go?</i>

01:36:27.337 --> 01:36:29.256
Cat burglar pulling another score?

01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:32.801
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

01:36:32.884 --> 01:36:35.345
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

01:36:36.012 --> 01:36:37.764
How could they do that to her?

01:36:37.847 --> 01:36:39.808
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:41.810
Her body was in his car.

01:36:41.893 --> 01:36:44.771
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

01:36:44.854 --> 01:36:47.857
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

01:36:47.941 --> 01:36:49.544
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

01:36:49.568 --> 01:36:51.194
She didn't know any better.

01:36:51.278 --> 01:36:52.672
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

01:36:52.696 --> 01:36:54.256
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:36:54.322 --> 01:36:55.883
It means your choices have consequences.

01:36:55.907 --> 01:36:58.285
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

01:36:58.368 --> 01:37:01.079
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

01:37:01.162 --> 01:37:02.998
- Was it worth it?
- What?

01:37:03.331 --> 01:37:05.500
Compromising yourself for money?

01:37:06.877 --> 01:37:09.129
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

01:37:10.755 --> 01:37:14.425
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

01:37:14.508 --> 01:37:15.902
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:37:15.926 --> 01:37:17.261
Falcone owes me that money.

01:37:17.344 --> 01:37:19.096
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

01:37:19.179 --> 01:37:20.014
Oh, really? Why's that?

01:37:20.097 --> 01:37:21.015
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

01:37:21.098 --> 01:37:22.850
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

01:37:22.933 --> 01:37:23.934
would owe you anything.

01:37:24.018 --> 01:37:26.353
Because he's my father!

01:37:35.487 --> 01:37:38.282
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

01:37:39.783 --> 01:37:41.076
Just like Anni.

01:37:43.245 --> 01:37:45.789
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

01:37:47.875 --> 01:37:49.210
To the club?

01:37:50.127 --> 01:37:51.128
Yeah.

01:37:53.839 --> 01:37:56.717
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

01:37:57.176 --> 01:37:58.928
Used to see him there.

01:37:59.678 --> 01:38:01.680
He scared the shit out of me.

01:38:03.641 --> 01:38:07.102
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

01:38:07.645 --> 01:38:11.482
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:17.196
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

01:38:17.863 --> 01:38:19.365
Strangled.

01:38:19.782 --> 01:38:23.244
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:27.206
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

01:38:27.289 --> 01:38:29.458
and he didn't say a thing.

01:38:31.293 --> 01:38:33.087
Couldn't even look at me.

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.592
He owes me that money.

01:38:40.386 --> 01:38:41.804
I'm sorry.

01:38:42.930 --> 01:38:44.098
For what I said.

01:38:45.474 --> 01:38:46.892
Oh, it's all right.

01:38:50.437 --> 01:38:52.523
You assume the worst in people.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.817
Which, well...

01:38:57.111 --> 01:38:59.029
maybe we're not so different after all.

01:39:04.493 --> 01:39:06.245
Who are you under there?

01:39:12.334 --> 01:39:14.211
What are you hiding?

01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:18.424
Are you just...

01:39:20.009 --> 01:39:21.719
hideously scarred?

01:39:23.846 --> 01:39:24.847
Yeah.

01:39:32.104 --> 01:39:33.522
Listen to me.

01:39:35.065 --> 01:39:37.943
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

01:39:39.111 --> 01:39:43.782
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

01:39:44.408 --> 01:39:47.494
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

01:39:47.578 --> 01:39:48.829
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

01:39:48.913 --> 01:39:50.193
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

01:39:50.247 --> 01:39:52.291
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

01:39:52.374 --> 01:39:53.626
I think you'd be on his side.

01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:55.389
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

01:39:55.419 --> 01:39:57.379
What, do you live in a cave?

01:39:57.463 --> 01:39:59.548
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

01:40:00.633 --> 01:40:04.511
Listen, if I can find
that dick bag Kenzie,

01:40:04.595 --> 01:40:05.804
will you help me?

01:40:07.056 --> 01:40:08.349
Please.

01:40:11.143 --> 01:40:13.062
Come on, Vengeance.

01:40:15.522 --> 01:40:17.775
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

01:40:17.858 --> 01:40:19.618
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

01:40:29.036 --> 01:40:30.579
I told you, baby.

01:40:32.498 --> 01:40:35.084
I can take care of myself.

01:40:45.886 --> 01:40:49.181
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

01:40:57.022 --> 01:41:00.609
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

01:41:00.734 --> 01:41:02.570
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

01:41:02.778 --> 01:41:05.197
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

01:41:05.364 --> 01:41:06.824
<i>it's a passion.</i>

01:41:07.533 --> 01:41:09.869
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

01:41:11.078 --> 01:41:13.414
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

01:41:13.497 --> 01:41:15.958
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

01:41:16.041 --> 01:41:19.211
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

01:41:20.546 --> 01:41:25.217
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

01:41:25.301 --> 01:41:28.971
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:31.223
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

01:41:31.307 --> 01:41:33.809
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

01:41:33.893 --> 01:41:35.519
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

01:41:35.603 --> 01:41:41.191
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

01:41:41.275 --> 01:41:45.946
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:48.407
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

01:41:49.241 --> 01:41:51.743
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

01:41:51.826 --> 01:41:55.747
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

01:41:55.872 --> 01:41:57.916
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

01:41:58.416 --> 01:42:02.712
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

01:42:02.795 --> 01:42:05.381
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

01:42:05.506 --> 01:42:08.551
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

01:42:09.135 --> 01:42:14.390
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

01:42:14.891 --> 01:42:17.268
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

01:42:17.352 --> 01:42:19.729
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

01:42:19.812 --> 01:42:23.274
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

01:42:23.358 --> 01:42:26.152
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

01:42:27.695 --> 01:42:29.531
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:42:35.286 --> 01:42:36.371
Do you know who I am?

01:42:37.997 --> 01:42:39.123
You're Bruce Wayne.

01:42:39.207 --> 01:42:41.084
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

01:42:51.844 --> 01:42:52.845
See?

01:43:04.148 --> 01:43:06.776
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

01:43:07.527 --> 01:43:09.654
Must have made a fortune.

01:43:10.113 --> 01:43:11.993
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

01:43:13.366 --> 01:43:15.827
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:16.911
No, boss.

01:43:16.995 --> 01:43:19.330
$1,183.

01:43:19.914 --> 01:43:21.875
You know why communism failed, right?

01:43:21.958 --> 01:43:22.959
No, boss.

01:43:24.878 --> 01:43:26.129
Austerity.

01:43:28.381 --> 01:43:30.008
All right. All right.

01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:32.677
Look at that. Perfect.

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:34.560
It's never gonna be that good again.

01:43:36.723 --> 01:43:39.225
Hey, Johnny Slick.

01:43:39.309 --> 01:43:40.476
What are you doing here?

01:43:42.395 --> 01:43:44.230
Give us a moment here, fellas.

01:43:45.148 --> 01:43:46.190
Come on.

01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:49.319
See ya, champ.

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:51.571
Come on, sweetheart.

01:43:53.531 --> 01:43:54.532
Have a seat.

01:43:56.576 --> 01:43:58.369
I thought I might hear from you.

01:43:59.537 --> 01:44:02.665
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

01:44:04.209 --> 01:44:06.002
stirring things up, huh?

01:44:06.085 --> 01:44:07.795
- Is it true?
- What?

01:44:09.088 --> 01:44:10.715
That reporter business?

01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:13.319
What do you want to know here, kid?

01:44:13.343 --> 01:44:16.137
Did you kill him? For my father?

01:44:16.221 --> 01:44:18.973
Look, your father was in trouble.

01:44:19.849 --> 01:44:21.643
This reporter had some dirt.

01:44:21.726 --> 01:44:23.353
Some very...

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.274
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

01:44:28.358 --> 01:44:31.069
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

01:44:31.152 --> 01:44:32.671
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

01:44:32.695 --> 01:44:34.614
not right before the election.

01:44:35.073 --> 01:44:37.367
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

01:44:37.450 --> 01:44:39.077
but he wasn't going for it.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:42.330
So, he came to me.

01:44:42.413 --> 01:44:44.791
Well, I never seen him like that.

01:44:45.625 --> 01:44:47.460
He said, "Carmine,

01:44:48.253 --> 01:44:52.966
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

01:44:55.385 --> 01:44:58.304
And when fear isn't enough...

01:44:58.972 --> 01:45:00.807
Oof. Hmm.

01:45:02.141 --> 01:45:05.478
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

01:45:06.479 --> 01:45:08.314
I handled it.

01:45:10.024 --> 01:45:11.442
I know.

01:45:11.526 --> 01:45:13.778
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

01:45:15.029 --> 01:45:16.865
But you'd be surprised

01:45:16.948 --> 01:45:19.325
what even a good man like him

01:45:19.409 --> 01:45:21.995
is capable of in the right situation.

01:45:24.247 --> 01:45:25.707
Do me a favor.

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:28.084
Don't lose any sleep over it.

01:45:28.793 --> 01:45:30.378
This reporter

01:45:31.212 --> 01:45:32.797
was a lowlife.

01:45:32.881 --> 01:45:34.340
He was on Maroni's payroll.

01:45:35.967 --> 01:45:37.594
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:38.344 --> 01:45:41.598
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

01:45:43.016 --> 01:45:46.519
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

01:45:46.603 --> 01:45:48.938
that your father would be in my pocket,

01:45:49.689 --> 01:45:50.690
forever.

01:45:51.357 --> 01:45:53.401
He would have done anything

01:45:53.484 --> 01:45:55.653
to keep him from becoming mayor.

01:45:55.737 --> 01:45:57.071
You understand?

01:45:58.281 --> 01:46:02.827
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

01:46:02.911 --> 01:46:04.954
Do I know it for a fact?

01:46:07.373 --> 01:46:09.459
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

01:46:10.835 --> 01:46:13.129
This is what you wanted, huh?

01:46:13.213 --> 01:46:15.632
This little conversation here?

01:46:18.051 --> 01:46:20.220
It's been a long time coming, huh?

01:46:22.847 --> 01:46:24.974
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

01:47:34.376 --> 01:47:35.669
You lied to me...

01:47:38.505 --> 01:47:40.132
my whole life.

01:47:45.304 --> 01:47:47.347
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

01:47:50.434 --> 01:47:53.729
He told me what he did for my father.

01:47:57.733 --> 01:47:59.234
About Salvatore Maroni.

01:48:01.236 --> 01:48:03.947
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

01:48:04.031 --> 01:48:05.782
Had my father killed.

01:48:08.243 --> 01:48:10.454
Why didn't you tell me all this?

01:48:13.207 --> 01:48:17.753
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

01:48:17.836 --> 01:48:20.172
believing that he was a good man.

01:48:20.255 --> 01:48:21.840
He was a good man.

01:48:23.008 --> 01:48:24.718
You listen to me.

01:48:24.801 --> 01:48:28.222
Your father was a good man.

01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:33.769
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

01:48:33.852 --> 01:48:35.771
He had a man killed.

01:48:35.854 --> 01:48:36.939
Why?

01:48:38.106 --> 01:48:41.360
To protect his family image?

01:48:42.444 --> 01:48:43.695
His political aspirations?

01:48:43.779 --> 01:48:47.324
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:51.453
He was protecting your mother.

01:48:52.412 --> 01:48:55.958
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

01:48:56.041 --> 01:48:58.168
He cared about her,

01:48:58.252 --> 01:48:59.545
and you,

01:48:59.628 --> 01:49:02.548
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

01:49:02.631 --> 01:49:06.093
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

01:49:06.969 --> 01:49:10.305
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

01:49:10.389 --> 01:49:13.517
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.435
That's who Falcone is.

01:49:17.688 --> 01:49:19.898
And that was your father's mistake.

01:49:19.982 --> 01:49:22.025
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

01:49:22.109 --> 01:49:24.862
your father was distraught.

01:49:25.737 --> 01:49:28.949
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

01:49:29.032 --> 01:49:31.201
that he would confess everything.

01:49:32.703 --> 01:49:34.705
And that night,

01:49:34.788 --> 01:49:38.709
your father and your mother were killed.

01:49:44.214 --> 01:49:45.966
It was Falcone?

01:49:52.014 --> 01:49:54.141
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

01:49:58.854 --> 01:50:02.399
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

01:50:02.482 --> 01:50:05.235
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

01:50:05.319 --> 01:50:10.532
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

01:50:12.284 --> 01:50:16.163
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:18.624
I know you always blamed yourself.

01:50:18.707 --> 01:50:21.251
You were only a boy, Bruce.

01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:25.714
I could see the fear in your eyes,

01:50:27.132 --> 01:50:29.509
but I didn't know how to help.

01:50:29.593 --> 01:50:32.095
I could teach you how to fight,

01:50:33.472 --> 01:50:36.141
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

01:50:36.225 --> 01:50:38.060
You needed a father.

01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:42.439
And all you had was me.

01:50:44.816 --> 01:50:46.026
I'm sorry.

01:50:47.778 --> 01:50:49.696
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

01:50:56.495 --> 01:50:57.579
God.

01:51:00.624 --> 01:51:05.045
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

01:51:07.756 --> 01:51:09.883
I thought I'd mastered all that.

01:51:16.305 --> 01:51:17.557
I mean,

01:51:18.766 --> 01:51:20.893
I'm not afraid to die.

01:51:22.645 --> 01:51:25.022
I realize now there's something

01:51:26.148 --> 01:51:28.025
I haven't got past.

01:51:28.943 --> 01:51:30.695
This fear...

01:51:33.155 --> 01:51:36.117
of ever going through any of that again.

01:51:40.371 --> 01:51:42.582
Of losing somebody I care about.

01:52:33.174 --> 01:52:34.174
Hey.

01:52:34.217 --> 01:52:36.969
I saw the signal. That's not you?

01:52:37.053 --> 01:52:38.971
I thought it was you.

01:52:51.901 --> 01:52:53.444
- I found him!
- I see that.

01:52:53.528 --> 01:52:55.029
He had my shit and my phone.

01:52:55.112 --> 01:52:56.381
She left a message
the night they took her.

01:52:56.405 --> 01:52:57.323
She called me...

01:52:57.406 --> 01:52:59.116
Gordon! Help me out, man!

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:00.493
She got my gun!

01:53:01.827 --> 01:53:03.538
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

01:53:05.081 --> 01:53:07.625
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

01:53:12.213 --> 01:53:14.298
Here. Listen.

01:53:16.259 --> 01:53:17.927
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

01:53:18.052 --> 01:53:20.252
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

01:53:20.304 --> 01:53:22.390
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

01:53:22.473 --> 01:53:23.808
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

01:53:23.891 --> 01:53:25.601
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

01:53:25.685 --> 01:53:26.787
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

01:53:26.811 --> 01:53:28.104
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

01:53:28.187 --> 01:53:30.857
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

01:53:32.733 --> 01:53:34.777
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

01:53:35.486 --> 01:53:38.030
<i>- What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
<i>- No, nothing. He...</i>

01:53:38.114 --> 01:53:41.033
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

01:53:41.117 --> 01:53:43.828
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

01:53:44.370 --> 01:53:46.372
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

01:53:47.081 --> 01:53:49.959
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

01:53:50.042 --> 01:53:52.753
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

01:53:52.837 --> 01:53:55.023
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

01:53:55.047 --> 01:53:58.175
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

01:53:59.010 --> 01:54:01.554
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

01:54:02.638 --> 01:54:03.973
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

01:54:04.765 --> 01:54:08.311
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

01:54:08.811 --> 01:54:10.021
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

01:54:10.104 --> 01:54:12.064
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

01:54:12.148 --> 01:54:13.441
<i>The deal.</i>

01:54:13.524 --> 01:54:18.446
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

01:54:18.529 --> 01:54:21.240
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

01:54:21.324 --> 01:54:23.701
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

01:54:23.784 --> 01:54:24.911
<i>Right.</i>

01:54:25.661 --> 01:54:27.038
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:54:27.997 --> 01:54:30.166
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:39.234
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

01:54:39.258 --> 01:54:40.801
Jesus, he's strangling her.

01:54:40.885 --> 01:54:43.930
<i>Take it easy.</i>

01:54:53.147 --> 01:54:54.440
<i>Rata A lad a.</i>

01:54:59.195 --> 01:55:00.988
A falcon has wings too.

01:55:01.322 --> 01:55:03.157
Falcone is the rat?

01:55:14.126 --> 01:55:17.296
Falcone works for you guys?

01:55:17.964 --> 01:55:20.508
The mayor? The DA?

01:55:23.511 --> 01:55:24.595
No.

01:55:27.682 --> 01:55:28.975
We work for him.

01:55:29.976 --> 01:55:31.227
Everybody does.

01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:32.311
How?

01:55:32.395 --> 01:55:33.980
Through Renewal.

01:55:34.772 --> 01:55:36.148
Renewal is everything.

01:55:36.232 --> 01:55:37.632
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:41.863
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

01:55:41.946 --> 01:55:45.533
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

01:55:45.616 --> 01:55:48.995
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

01:55:49.078 --> 01:55:51.163
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

01:55:51.247 --> 01:55:52.956
Everybody got a piece.

01:55:53.039 --> 01:55:54.875
But Falcone wanted more.

01:55:56.668 --> 01:55:59.880
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

01:56:01.298 --> 01:56:03.633
He'd rat out his drops operation,

01:56:04.009 --> 01:56:06.720
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

01:56:06.803 --> 01:56:09.264
then install them all as his puppets.

01:56:09.347 --> 01:56:11.892
You think this goddamn election matters?

01:56:13.518 --> 01:56:15.437
Falcone's the mayor.

01:56:16.396 --> 01:56:18.899
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

01:56:18.982 --> 01:56:20.358
Come on, Vengeance.

01:56:21.067 --> 01:56:22.903
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

01:56:23.612 --> 01:56:25.298
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

01:56:25.322 --> 01:56:26.156
No!

01:56:27.616 --> 01:56:28.825
We'll get him.

01:56:29.492 --> 01:56:31.369
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

01:56:31.453 --> 01:56:32.579
He owns the city!

01:56:32.662 --> 01:56:33.914
Cross that line...

01:56:34.706 --> 01:56:35.999
you'll become just like him.

01:56:36.708 --> 01:56:38.251
Listen to me.

01:56:38.335 --> 01:56:40.212
Don't throw your life away.

01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:48.136
Don't worry, honey.

01:56:51.223 --> 01:56:52.682
I got nine of 'em.

01:56:52.807 --> 01:56:54.768
No, don't! Hey, hey!

01:56:56.061 --> 01:56:57.354
Oh, God!

01:57:06.655 --> 01:57:07.924
She won't get out of there alive.

01:57:07.948 --> 01:57:10.534
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

01:57:10.617 --> 01:57:11.618
I have to stop her.

01:57:11.785 --> 01:57:12.785
Don't you mean "we"?

01:57:14.079 --> 01:57:15.622
I gotta do this my way.

01:57:15.956 --> 01:57:16.957
And then what?

01:57:17.832 --> 01:57:19.209
We do what Riddler said.

01:57:20.043 --> 01:57:21.670
Bring the rat into the light.

01:57:57.622 --> 01:57:59.666
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

01:57:59.749 --> 01:58:01.209
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

01:58:01.835 --> 01:58:03.169
Tell him it's about Annika.

01:58:06.423 --> 01:58:07.757
Hey!

01:58:08.592 --> 01:58:10.010
Look who it is, huh?

01:58:10.093 --> 01:58:12.512
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

01:58:12.596 --> 01:58:14.598
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

01:58:14.764 --> 01:58:16.224
Absolutely.

01:58:17.976 --> 01:58:18.977
Alone?

01:58:35.535 --> 01:58:36.620
Hey!

01:58:47.172 --> 01:58:48.441
I'm just so worried.

01:58:48.465 --> 01:58:50.091
I don't know where she is.

01:58:51.843 --> 01:58:55.222
And I know
that you're a very important man.

01:58:55.305 --> 01:58:58.725
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

01:59:00.227 --> 01:59:02.604
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

01:59:04.064 --> 01:59:05.190
I'm sorry.

01:59:05.398 --> 01:59:06.483
It's okay.

01:59:06.566 --> 01:59:08.693
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:11.738
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

01:59:15.992 --> 01:59:16.910
Mr. Falcone?

01:59:16.993 --> 01:59:18.453
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

01:59:18.537 --> 01:59:21.456
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

01:59:23.833 --> 01:59:25.335
I'm sorry, beautiful.

01:59:25.418 --> 01:59:26.836
I'll be right back.

01:59:42.143 --> 01:59:43.228
Holy shit.

01:59:43.311 --> 01:59:45.039
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

01:59:45.063 --> 01:59:47.774

01:59:47.858 --> 01:59:50.694

01:59:53.613 --> 01:59:57.117
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

01:59:57.242 --> 01:59:58.785
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

01:59:58.952 --> 02:00:00.620
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

02:00:00.704 --> 02:00:02.205
<i>The deal.</i>

02:00:02.289 --> 02:00:07.085
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

02:00:07.168 --> 02:00:10.088
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

02:00:10.171 --> 02:00:12.716
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

02:00:12.799 --> 02:00:13.800
<i>Right.</i>

02:00:14.676 --> 02:00:15.886
<i>Hmm.</i>

02:00:15.969 --> 02:00:17.178

02:00:28.732 --> 02:00:29.983
Hey, Dad.

02:00:31.026 --> 02:00:32.026
What?

02:00:32.484 --> 02:00:34.528
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

02:00:36.155 --> 02:00:37.615
You remember her?

02:00:39.658 --> 02:00:40.701
Yeah.

02:00:44.997 --> 02:00:46.141
Just put down the gun, honey.

02:00:46.165 --> 02:00:47.249
This is for my mother.

02:01:44.515 --> 02:01:45.683
I see him!

02:02:29.727 --> 02:02:31.478
You don't think this hurts me?

02:02:36.066 --> 02:02:38.360
My own flesh and blood, huh?

02:02:54.752 --> 02:02:56.587
You made me do this.

02:02:58.005 --> 02:02:59.798
Just like your mother.

02:03:05.804 --> 02:03:07.139
He has to pay!

02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:12.300
You don't have to pay with him.

02:03:15.814 --> 02:03:17.316
You paid enough.

02:03:51.892 --> 02:03:53.018
Jesus.

02:03:53.102 --> 02:03:55.813
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

02:03:55.896 --> 02:03:58.983
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

02:03:59.066 --> 02:04:00.317
I'm gonna start crying,

02:04:00.401 --> 02:04:02.903
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

02:04:02.987 --> 02:04:04.613
Let me tell you something.

02:04:04.697 --> 02:04:06.407
Whatever I know,

02:04:06.490 --> 02:04:08.367
whatever I've done,

02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:12.788
it's all going with me to my grave.

02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:25.301
What, are you with Zorro over here?

02:04:26.927 --> 02:04:29.221
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

02:04:37.146 --> 02:04:39.481
I guess we don't all work for you.

02:04:48.490 --> 02:04:50.034
You have the right to remain silent.

02:04:50.868 --> 02:04:54.371
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

02:04:54.455 --> 02:04:55.815
You have the right to an attorney.

02:04:55.873 --> 02:04:57.041
If you cannot afford one,

02:04:57.124 --> 02:04:58.918
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

02:04:59.001 --> 02:05:00.711
Do you understand these rights?

02:05:02.213 --> 02:05:03.797
Do you understand?

02:05:05.758 --> 02:05:06.842
Yeah.

02:05:06.926 --> 02:05:09.011
I'll see you when I walk out.

02:05:09.094 --> 02:05:10.155
With these rights in mind,

02:05:10.179 --> 02:05:11.531
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

02:05:11.555 --> 02:05:12.805
Goddamn rat.

02:05:14.766 --> 02:05:16.100
What'd you say?

02:05:16.184 --> 02:05:17.936
Enjoy your night at Black gate, Carmine.

02:05:19.062 --> 02:05:20.313
Probably be your last.

02:05:20.563 --> 02:05:23.608
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

02:05:23.691 --> 02:05:24.776
Maybe I am.

02:05:24.859 --> 02:05:26.069
Really, Oz?

02:05:26.152 --> 02:05:30.865
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

02:05:30.949 --> 02:05:32.033
I'll spray paint your ass!

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:37.440
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

02:05:37.664 --> 02:05:39.666
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.460
Get your hands off of me!

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:04.023
"Bring him into the light.

02:06:07.610 --> 02:06:09.571
And you'll find where I'm at."

02:06:09.654 --> 02:06:10.738
There!

02:06:10.822 --> 02:06:12.657
The shots came from up there!

02:06:14.242 --> 02:06:15.243
It's Riddler.

02:06:17.328 --> 02:06:18.496
Gage, on me.

02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:21.291
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

02:07:35.490 --> 02:07:36.699
He's gone.

02:07:46.501 --> 02:07:48.461
He's been here this whole time.

02:07:48.545 --> 02:07:50.880
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

02:07:50.964 --> 02:07:52.149
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

02:07:52.173 --> 02:07:54.902
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

02:07:54.926 --> 02:07:57.387
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

02:07:57.470 --> 02:08:00.390
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

02:08:15.905 --> 02:08:17.991
Police! Hands up!

02:08:21.035 --> 02:08:24.539
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

02:08:43.683 --> 02:08:45.602
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

02:08:48.563 --> 02:08:49.856
Stay still!

02:08:49.939 --> 02:08:50.940
Now!

02:09:19.594 --> 02:09:21.387
Which one is you?

02:09:21.471 --> 02:09:22.972
You tell me.

02:09:23.806 --> 02:09:25.266
Let's go, pencil-neck.

02:09:28.353 --> 02:09:30.104
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

02:09:44.619 --> 02:09:47.539
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

02:09:47.622 --> 02:09:50.208

<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.002
Hey.

02:10:18.443 --> 02:10:20.153
What are all these diaries?

02:10:20.237 --> 02:10:22.656
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

02:10:22.739 --> 02:10:26.285
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

02:10:26.368 --> 02:10:27.911
Got something back on one of the IDs.

02:10:27.995 --> 02:10:30.289
Edward Nash ton. Works at KTMJ.

02:10:30.372 --> 02:10:32.207
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

02:10:32.291 --> 02:10:34.710
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

02:10:34.793 --> 02:10:36.545
What about chain of evidence?

02:10:37.379 --> 02:10:38.589
You should see this.

02:10:44.553 --> 02:10:46.054
He's wearing gloves.

02:10:47.514 --> 02:10:49.766
"Friday, July 16th.

02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:53.562
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

02:10:53.896 --> 02:10:56.940
suffocating my mind, no escape.

02:10:57.024 --> 02:10:58.442
But then, today, I saw it.

02:10:58.525 --> 02:11:02.654
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

02:11:03.989 --> 02:11:05.782
'Renewal.'

02:11:05.866 --> 02:11:10.287
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:13.498
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

02:11:13.582 --> 02:11:16.919
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:19.463
The moment when I would learn the truth.

02:11:19.546 --> 02:11:22.549
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

02:11:23.675 --> 02:11:25.570
"If you want people to understand,

02:11:25.594 --> 02:11:27.429
really understand,

02:11:27.512 --> 02:11:29.806
you can't just give them the answers.

02:11:29.890 --> 02:11:31.350
You have to confront them,

02:11:31.433 --> 02:11:33.852
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

02:11:33.936 --> 02:11:36.104
just like they tortured me.

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:38.982
I know now what I must become."

02:11:41.944 --> 02:11:43.278
Jesus.

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:51.328
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:53.372
This one's not a rat.

02:12:10.013 --> 02:12:11.139
What is that?

02:12:42.754 --> 02:12:44.023
Some kind of pry tool?

02:12:44.047 --> 02:12:45.424
Is it a chisel?

02:12:45.507 --> 02:12:46.967
It's a murder weapon.

02:12:47.050 --> 02:12:48.427
He killed Mitchell with it.

02:12:49.094 --> 02:12:51.972
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

02:13:00.564 --> 02:13:02.566
"My confession"?

02:13:02.649 --> 02:13:05.527
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

02:13:05.611 --> 02:13:06.987
This isn't over.

02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:09.590
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

02:13:09.907 --> 02:13:12.117
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

02:13:20.209 --> 02:13:22.419
His final post was last night.

02:13:22.502 --> 02:13:25.714
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

02:13:25.797 --> 02:13:28.800
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

02:13:28.926 --> 02:13:32.346
Take some time, but we'll get in.

02:13:43.690 --> 02:13:46.235
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

"The Truth Unmasked."

02:13:50.405 --> 02:13:52.032
I think I'm his last target.

02:13:54.618 --> 02:13:55.702
You?

02:13:56.078 --> 02:13:58.121
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

02:13:58.664 --> 02:14:00.040
What is?

02:14:00.499 --> 02:14:01.917
The Batman.

02:14:07.297 --> 02:14:08.465
Yeah?

02:14:19.768 --> 02:14:20.978
Right.

02:14:23.856 --> 02:14:27.818
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

02:14:35.283 --> 02:14:36.784
You're a good cop.

<i>What do you want from me?</i>

02:15:06.439 --> 02:15:07.982
"Want"?

02:15:08.566 --> 02:15:12.195
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

02:15:13.404 --> 02:15:14.739
<i>For this moment.</i>

02:15:15.781 --> 02:15:18.784
I've been invisible my whole life.

02:15:19.869 --> 02:15:22.496
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:26.459
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

02:15:26.542 --> 02:15:28.377
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

<i>Bruce...</i>

02:15:43.601 --> 02:15:45.436

<i>Wayne.</i>

02:16:07.124 --> 02:16:09.544
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

02:16:15.591 --> 02:16:17.969
<i>made all those promises.</i>

02:16:20.429 --> 02:16:24.684
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

02:16:25.226 --> 02:16:28.771
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

02:16:28.855 --> 02:16:32.525
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

02:16:33.109 --> 02:16:34.652
<i>Orphan.</i>

02:16:40.324 --> 02:16:45.454
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

02:16:46.747 --> 02:16:51.377
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

02:16:52.044 --> 02:16:53.588
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

02:16:56.215 --> 02:16:58.885
Do you know what being an orphan is?

02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:01.846
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

02:17:03.139 --> 02:17:07.185
<i>Twelve years old and already a drop head,
numbing the pain.</i>

02:17:08.895 --> 02:17:13.566
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

02:17:14.734 --> 02:17:17.904
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

02:17:17.987 --> 02:17:20.281
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

02:17:21.574 --> 02:17:24.160
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

02:17:27.079 --> 02:17:30.249
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

02:17:30.333 --> 02:17:33.252
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

02:17:33.336 --> 02:17:34.337
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

02:17:35.796 --> 02:17:37.840
<i>Bruce...</i>

02:17:38.883 --> 02:17:40.801
<i>Wayne.</i>

<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

02:17:55.566 --> 02:17:59.445
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

02:18:02.615 --> 02:18:03.783
<i>God.</i>

02:18:04.784 --> 02:18:06.077
<i>Look at you.</i>

02:18:07.745 --> 02:18:10.206
Your mask is amazing.

02:18:10.289 --> 02:18:13.209
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

02:18:13.292 --> 02:18:14.377
Ain't it funny?

02:18:14.460 --> 02:18:18.881
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

02:18:20.341 --> 02:18:22.385
<i>You and I both know</i>

02:18:23.344 --> 02:18:25.846
I'm looking at the real you right now.

02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:29.559
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

02:18:29.642 --> 02:18:31.185
<i>No shame,</i>

02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:33.104
<i>no limits.</i>

02:18:33.187 --> 02:18:34.856
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

02:18:35.731 --> 02:18:36.732
<i>What do you mean?</i>

02:18:36.816 --> 02:18:38.526
<i>All those cards.</i>

02:18:38.609 --> 02:18:39.819
<i>I told you,</i>

02:18:40.528 --> 02:18:42.506
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

02:18:42.530 --> 02:18:44.740
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

02:18:44.824 --> 02:18:46.284
<i>What did we just do?</i>

02:18:46.367 --> 02:18:48.428
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

02:18:48.452 --> 02:18:49.620
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

02:18:49.704 --> 02:18:50.705
<i>We're not a team.</i>

02:18:50.788 --> 02:18:53.291
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

02:18:53.374 --> 02:18:55.793
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

02:18:55.877 --> 02:18:59.046
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:00.770
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:02.049
You gave me that.

02:19:02.133 --> 02:19:03.259
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

02:19:03.342 --> 02:19:05.928
You showed me what was possible.

02:19:06.012 --> 02:19:10.892
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:12.518
<i>You inspired me.</i>

02:19:12.602 --> 02:19:14.102
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

02:19:15.228 --> 02:19:16.313
<i>What?</i>

02:19:16.396 --> 02:19:18.565
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

02:19:18.648 --> 02:19:20.025
<i>How can you say that?</i>

02:19:20.108 --> 02:19:21.610
You think you'll be remembered?

02:19:21.693 --> 02:19:23.361
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

02:19:23.862 --> 02:19:25.614
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

02:19:25.697 --> 02:19:27.365
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

02:19:27.449 --> 02:19:28.491
<i>No, no!</i>

02:19:28.575 --> 02:19:29.575
<i>A nobody!</i>

02:19:31.286 --> 02:19:33.079
<i>No!</i>

02:19:34.998 --> 02:19:37.375
<i>Ahhh!</i>

02:19:37.626 --> 02:19:40.212
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

02:19:41.171 --> 02:19:44.799
<i>Ahhh!</i>

02:19:44.883 --> 02:19:47.510
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

02:19:48.511 --> 02:19:50.513
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

02:19:50.889 --> 02:19:54.184
We could watch the whole thing together.

02:19:54.267 --> 02:19:55.268
<i>Watch what?</i>

02:19:55.352 --> 02:19:57.103
<i>Everything!</i>

02:20:05.445 --> 02:20:07.113
<i>It was all there.</i>

02:20:09.282 --> 02:20:11.618
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

02:20:15.914 --> 02:20:19.834
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

02:20:21.878 --> 02:20:23.964
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

02:20:24.422 --> 02:20:25.674
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:26.383 --> 02:20:31.263
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

02:20:34.099 --> 02:20:35.934
<i>You.</i>

02:20:37.602 --> 02:20:39.729
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

02:20:41.064 --> 02:20:42.607
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:49.990
<i>Ave Maria</i>

02:20:50.407 --> 02:20:52.284
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:54.744 --> 02:20:56.121
<i>Gratia plena</i>

02:20:56.288 --> 02:20:57.706
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:05.088
<i>Maria</i>

02:21:05.255 --> 02:21:10.802
<i>Gratia plena</i>

02:22:04.272 --> 02:22:06.858
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

02:22:13.448 --> 02:22:15.909
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

02:22:16.785 --> 02:22:19.538
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

02:22:24.209 --> 02:22:27.254
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

02:22:27.337 --> 02:22:29.506
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

02:22:29.589 --> 02:22:31.841
It's a tucker.

02:22:49.651 --> 02:22:50.652
Huh.

02:23:05.834 --> 02:23:08.628
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

02:23:08.712 --> 02:23:10.213

02:23:40.744 --> 02:23:42.162
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

02:23:42.495 --> 02:23:44.706
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

02:23:44.789 --> 02:23:47.751
<i>and a special thanks to everyone

02:23:47.834 --> 02:23:48.835
Detonators?

02:23:48.919 --> 02:23:53.964

Jesus.

<i>Tomorrow's Election Day.</i>

<i>She promised real change.</i>

<i>But we know the truth, don't we?</i>

02:24:28.499 --> 02:24:30.584
<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

02:24:30.668 --> 02:24:32.545
<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

02:24:32.628 --> 02:24:35.589
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

02:24:35.673 --> 02:24:39.510

02:24:39.593 --> 02:24:43.430

02:24:45.641 --> 02:24:49.645
<i>The day of judgment is finally upon us.</i>

02:24:49.728 --> 02:24:52.106
<i>And now it is time</i>

02:24:55.651 --> 02:24:58.445

02:25:02.283 --> 02:25:04.159
<i>And on the big night,</i>

Boom!

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

<i>Those who are not washed away</i>

02:25:46.994 --> 02:25:49.121
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

<i>...celebrations will turn to panic,</i>

02:25:57.504 --> 02:26:02.343

02:26:03.719 --> 02:26:07.723
<i>And that's where all of you come in.</i>

02:26:14.146 --> 02:26:17.441
<i>Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.</i>

02:26:17.525 --> 02:26:19.693

<i>We'll give them real, real change now.</i>

02:26:54.019 --> 02:26:59.024
<i>We've spent our lives in this

02:26:59.483 --> 02:27:01.986
<i>Wondering, "Why us?"</i>

02:27:02.069 --> 02:27:05.197
<i>Now they will spend

02:27:05.281 --> 02:27:07.449
<i>why them?</i>

02:27:07.533 --> 02:27:09.577
I can't get through! The lines are down.

02:27:15.207 --> 02:27:17.376
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:19.587
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:22.548
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

02:27:22.631 --> 02:27:24.651
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

02:27:34.226 --> 02:27:35.954
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

02:27:35.978 --> 02:27:37.539
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

02:27:37.563 --> 02:27:39.398
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

02:27:39.481 --> 02:27:40.733
We got an active situation.

02:27:40.858 --> 02:27:42.210
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

02:27:42.234 --> 02:27:43.503
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

02:27:43.527 --> 02:27:44.445
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

02:27:44.528 --> 02:27:45.362
Come!

02:28:21.398 --> 02:28:22.876
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:23.776
...we're gonna have huge problems.

02:28:23.859 --> 02:28:25.295
The water's already started to breach.

02:28:25.319 --> 02:28:26.922
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

02:28:26.946 --> 02:28:29.216
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:31.134
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

02:28:31.158 --> 02:28:33.552
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

02:28:33.576 --> 02:28:35.888
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

02:28:35.912 --> 02:28:38.164
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

02:28:38.248 --> 02:28:40.083
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

02:28:40.166 --> 02:28:43.169
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

02:28:43.253 --> 02:28:44.754
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

02:28:49.926 --> 02:28:53.388
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

02:28:53.471 --> 02:28:55.765
Please! I just need your attention!

02:29:11.656 --> 02:29:12.782
You're okay!

02:30:43.706 --> 02:30:46.334
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

02:30:46.417 --> 02:30:47.627
Follow me, sir.

02:32:57.632 --> 02:32:59.133
No, no. It's okay.

02:32:59.217 --> 02:33:00.260
It's okay.

02:33:01.427 --> 02:33:02.470
It's okay.

02:33:04.097 --> 02:33:06.224
It's done now. It's done.

02:33:08.935 --> 02:33:10.270
It's over.

02:34:06.116 --> 02:34:09.578
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

02:34:10.287 --> 02:34:12.623
Take it easy. Easy.

02:34:41.193 --> 02:34:42.319
Jesus.

02:34:52.162 --> 02:34:53.830
Who the hell are you?

02:34:58.043 --> 02:34:59.044
Me?

02:35:02.214 --> 02:35:03.632
I'm Vengeance.

<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

02:38:57.615 --> 02:39:01.327
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

<i>in the parts of the city

02:39:05.122 --> 02:39:08.834
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

02:39:11.796 --> 02:39:14.924
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:17.677
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

02:39:18.302 --> 02:39:19.762
But not just our city.

02:39:20.471 --> 02:39:24.684
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

02:39:24.767 --> 02:39:26.853
in our elected officials,

02:39:26.936 --> 02:39:28.229
in each other.

02:39:29.021 --> 02:39:32.358
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

02:39:36.696 --> 02:39:38.364
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

02:39:39.824 --> 02:39:41.993

02:39:44.078 --> 02:39:45.997

<i>I have to become more.</i>

02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:04.307
<i>People need hope.</i>

02:40:05.516 --> 02:40:07.727
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

02:40:11.522 --> 02:40:13.191
<i>The city's angry,</i>

02:40:14.108 --> 02:40:15.484

<i>like me.</i>

02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:21.866
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

02:40:23.242 --> 02:40:25.953
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:29.332
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

02:40:30.833 --> 02:40:32.710
<i>they can transform us.</i>

02:40:34.587 --> 02:40:36.505
<i>They can give us the power</i>

02:40:37.465 --> 02:40:38.966
<i>to endure...</i>

02:40:40.343 --> 02:40:42.470
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

02:40:45.389 --> 02:40:47.558
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

02:40:47.642 --> 02:40:50.436
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:52.104
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

02:40:52.188 --> 02:40:53.874
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

02:40:53.898 --> 02:40:56.901
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

02:40:56.984 --> 02:40:59.529
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

02:40:59.612 --> 02:41:02.007
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

02:41:02.031 --> 02:41:04.492
Isn't that just terrible?

02:41:05.868 --> 02:41:07.787
Him...

02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:10.748
raining on your parade like that?

02:41:16.462 --> 02:41:18.464
What is it they say?

02:41:19.632 --> 02:41:21.801
"One day you're on top,

02:41:23.344 --> 02:41:25.012
the next...

02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:28.307
you're a clown."

02:41:30.685 --> 02:41:31.853
Well,

02:41:33.646 --> 02:41:36.482
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

02:41:38.776 --> 02:41:41.445
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

02:41:42.738 --> 02:41:44.574
You did so well.

02:41:49.078 --> 02:41:50.079
And you know,

02:41:51.747 --> 02:41:54.959
Gotham loves a comeback story.

02:42:05.011 --> 02:42:06.387
Who are you?

02:42:06.929 --> 02:42:09.348
Well, that's the question,

02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:11.767
isn't it?

02:42:14.687 --> 02:42:17.064
Riddle me this...

02:42:19.525 --> 02:42:21.652
"The less of them you have,

02:42:22.403 --> 02:42:26.240
the more one is worth."

02:42:31.662 --> 02:42:33.414
A friend.

02:42:59.648 --> 02:43:01.048
You're leaving.

02:43:01.566 --> 02:43:02.651
Jesus.

02:43:04.402 --> 02:43:05.987
Don't you ever just say hello?

02:43:11.076 --> 02:43:12.494
Where will you go?

02:43:13.995 --> 02:43:16.414
I don't know. Upstate.

02:43:16.831 --> 02:43:18.542
Bludhaven, maybe.

02:43:19.417 --> 02:43:20.418
Why?

02:43:21.628 --> 02:43:22.837
You asking me to stay?

02:43:29.886 --> 02:43:32.013
You know this place
is never gonna change.

02:43:32.430 --> 02:43:34.766
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

02:43:34.850 --> 02:43:36.768
There's gonna be a power grab.

02:43:38.395 --> 02:43:39.521
It'll be bloody.

02:43:40.146 --> 02:43:41.356
I know.

02:43:42.899 --> 02:43:43.984
But the city can change.

02:43:44.067 --> 02:43:45.318
It won't.

02:43:46.444 --> 02:43:47.445
I have to try.

02:43:47.529 --> 02:43:49.329
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

02:43:51.616 --> 02:43:52.742
Listen.

02:43:55.161 --> 02:43:56.413
Why don't you come with me?

02:43:57.372 --> 02:43:58.874
Get into some trouble.

02:43:59.624 --> 02:44:03.128
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

02:44:03.795 --> 02:44:05.422
The bat and the cat.

02:44:06.923 --> 02:44:08.592
It's got a nice ring.

02:44:21.938 --> 02:44:23.356
Who am I kidding?

02:44:24.816 --> 02:44:26.943
You're already spoken for.

02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:40.248
You should go.

02:44:48.590 --> 02:44:49.591
Selina...

02:44:53.678 --> 02:44:55.347
Take care of yourself.
