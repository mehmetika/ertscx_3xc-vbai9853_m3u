00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:31.866
Hey!

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:01.562
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.569
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:10.196
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.615
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:16.535
<i>And 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.120
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:21.666
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.795
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:27.630
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:30.466
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.069
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:36.264
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:39.141
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:40.661
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:41.602
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:43.938
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:45.064
<i>Under my administration,</i>

00:02:45.147 --> 00:02:48.943
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:52.530
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:54.907
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:55.991
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:57.386
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.428
<i>But listen...</i>

00:02:58.452 --> 00:02:59.930
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:01.414
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:06.919
Hey.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.090
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.972
Why is she still tied?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.563
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:35.072
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:37.033
Just call me in the morning, okay?

00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:42.723
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

00:03:42.747 --> 00:03:45.291
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

00:03:45.374 --> 00:03:48.044
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.833
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:25.432
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:30.270
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

00:05:33.773 --> 00:05:37.235
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

00:05:38.153 --> 00:05:40.238
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.241
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

00:05:44.284 --> 00:05:45.994
<i>Watching.</i>

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:52.000
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.175
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

00:06:13.813 --> 00:06:15.791
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:18.443
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

00:06:18.526 --> 00:06:20.028
<i>It's a big city.</i>

00:06:24.658 --> 00:06:26.368
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

00:06:36.962 --> 00:06:38.880
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

00:06:44.052 --> 00:06:45.804
Look at this guy, man.

00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:52.142
Boom!

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:53.311
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:06:57.065 --> 00:06:58.960
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:00.584
Yo, let's see your hits.

00:07:01.236 --> 00:07:02.612
That's you.

00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:27.012
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

00:07:28.722 --> 00:07:30.974
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.852
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

00:07:35.437 --> 00:07:36.980
<i>It's a warning.</i>

00:07:38.773 --> 00:07:39.774
<i>To them.</i>

00:07:49.492 --> 00:07:50.702
<i>Fear...</i>

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:55.832
<i>Is a tool.</i>

00:08:06.927 --> 00:08:10.096
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drop head!

00:08:21.942 --> 00:08:24.486
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:28.448
Come on!

00:08:36.872 --> 00:08:38.791
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.720
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:01.665
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:03.148
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

00:09:04.108 --> 00:09:05.359
Help!

00:09:05.442 --> 00:09:06.652
Somebody help me!

00:09:07.444 --> 00:09:09.446
Help, help!

00:09:16.328 --> 00:09:17.722
Where you goin', huh?

00:09:22.334 --> 00:09:23.334
Come on.

00:09:23.377 --> 00:09:25.045
Come on, man. Break it.

00:09:27.214 --> 00:09:28.632
You can't move, huh?

00:09:29.008 --> 00:09:30.718
Now knock his ass out.

00:09:30.801 --> 00:09:32.511
Showtime. Showtime, man.

00:09:33.053 --> 00:09:34.138
Come on, man.

00:09:34.221 --> 00:09:35.472
Come on. Do it, man.

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:12.426
You see this guy?

00:10:19.642 --> 00:10:21.268
The hell are you supposed to be?

00:10:38.285 --> 00:10:39.578
I'm vengeance.

00:10:40.704 --> 00:10:42.623
Holy shit. It's him.

00:11:08.315 --> 00:11:09.441
Hey, man. No, no, no!

00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:52.568
Please don't hurt me.

00:12:28.604 --> 00:12:30.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:32.983
Police action.

00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:35.236
He's with me, Officer.

00:12:37.488 --> 00:12:39.073
Are you kidding me, sir?

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.742
You're gonna let him in here?

00:12:42.409 --> 00:12:45.204
Martinez, let him through.

00:12:58.842 --> 00:13:00.594
Goddamn freak.

00:13:16.484 --> 00:13:17.569
What do we know?

00:13:28.413 --> 00:13:29.789
Detective?

00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:31.499
Sorry, Lieutenant.

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:36.880
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.800
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.597
All this blood is from his head?

00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:47.056
No.

00:13:51.394 --> 00:13:52.604
Excuse me.

00:13:54.898 --> 00:13:56.774
Most of it's from his hand.

00:14:02.238 --> 00:14:03.281
Thumb was severed.

00:14:04.908 --> 00:14:07.118
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

00:14:07.493 --> 00:14:09.412
He was alive when it was cut off.

00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:12.123
Ecchymosis...

00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:14.918
around the wound.

00:14:30.141 --> 00:14:31.851
Security detail downstairs

00:14:31.935 --> 00:14:34.145
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

00:14:35.647 --> 00:14:37.857
The mayor was up here alone.

00:14:40.276 --> 00:14:42.987
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:51.162
You said there was a card.

00:14:51.246 --> 00:14:52.830
Yeah.

00:15:02.966 --> 00:15:06.010
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

00:15:07.303 --> 00:15:09.013
Haven't a clue?

00:15:09.097 --> 00:15:11.474
Let's play a game, just me and you.

00:15:12.517 --> 00:15:15.061
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

00:15:16.396 --> 00:15:18.481
There's a cipher too.

00:15:25.238 --> 00:15:27.115
Any of this mean anything to you?

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:30.868
What's going on here?

00:15:33.955 --> 00:15:35.373
I asked him to come, Pete.

00:15:35.456 --> 00:15:37.125
This is a crime scene.

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:39.544
It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!

00:15:39.627 --> 00:15:41.629
I got the press downstairs.

00:15:41.713 --> 00:15:44.465
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:46.384
But this is way over the line.

00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:51.139
Wait.

00:15:51.222 --> 00:15:52.992
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

00:15:53.016 --> 00:15:54.142
How do you know?

00:15:54.225 --> 00:15:57.228
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

00:15:57.312 --> 00:15:59.123
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

00:15:59.147 --> 00:16:00.833
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

00:16:00.857 --> 00:16:02.400
He lies still.

00:16:03.902 --> 00:16:04.903
Excuse me?

00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:07.530
The riddle.

00:16:08.114 --> 00:16:11.534
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:22.170
Oh, Jesus.

00:16:25.423 --> 00:16:28.218
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

00:16:29.219 --> 00:16:31.054
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

00:16:31.846 --> 00:16:33.473
Excuse me, Commissioner.

00:16:34.557 --> 00:16:36.226
They're ready for your statement.

00:16:40.271 --> 00:16:41.981
I want him outta here.

00:16:42.607 --> 00:16:43.691
Now!

00:16:50.281 --> 00:16:51.491
Come on.

00:17:04.295 --> 00:17:05.505
Yeah.

00:17:06.756 --> 00:17:08.174
The kid found him.

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:16.182
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

00:17:32.615 --> 00:17:34.784
We really gotta go, man.

00:17:40.373 --> 00:17:44.085
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

00:17:44.544 --> 00:17:46.379
A wife lost a husband.

00:17:47.589 --> 00:17:49.132
And I lost a friend.

00:17:50.216 --> 00:17:52.759
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

00:17:52.843 --> 00:17:55.929
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

00:17:56.388 --> 00:17:58.557
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

00:17:59.308 --> 00:18:02.728
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

00:18:02.811 --> 00:18:06.899
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

00:18:06.982 --> 00:18:08.233
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:11.153
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

00:18:11.236 --> 00:18:12.821
<i>but I don't know.</i>

00:18:18.744 --> 00:18:21.622
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

00:18:21.705 --> 00:18:23.790
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:25.876
<i>And now this.</i>

00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:29.630
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:33.592
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:37.971
<i>But I have to try.</i>

00:18:38.764 --> 00:18:40.015
<i>Push myself.</i>

00:19:26.103 --> 00:19:28.605
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:31.483
<i>behind the mask.</i>

00:19:35.988 --> 00:19:38.282
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

00:19:40.075 --> 00:19:42.244
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:46.206
<i>everything that happened.</i>

00:20:00.762 --> 00:20:02.407
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:06.310
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:20:06.393 --> 00:20:09.229
<i>Was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

00:20:09.313 --> 00:20:11.064
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:12.816
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.401
<i>still have not been released,</i>

00:20:14.484 --> 00:20:17.362
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

00:20:17.446 --> 00:20:20.699
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

00:20:20.824 --> 00:20:22.618
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:25.245
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:29.583
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:31.418
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:33.462
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:36.381
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

00:20:36.465 --> 00:20:40.302
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

00:20:40.385 --> 00:20:42.179
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

00:20:42.262 --> 00:20:44.932
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:48.268
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

00:20:48.352 --> 00:20:52.314
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

00:20:52.397 --> 00:20:56.568
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

00:20:56.652 --> 00:20:58.070
I assume you heard about this.

00:20:59.947 --> 00:21:01.227
Yeah.

00:21:08.205 --> 00:21:09.539
Oh, I see.

00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:12.334
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

00:21:12.834 --> 00:21:14.044
Dear God.

00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:24.846
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

00:21:32.854 --> 00:21:35.148
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

00:21:38.318 --> 00:21:40.112
The killer left this for the Batman?

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.198
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

00:21:43.282 --> 00:21:44.283
Apparently.

00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:46.451
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:49.830
Why is he writing to you?

00:21:49.913 --> 00:21:51.391
<i>It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!</i>

00:21:51.415 --> 00:21:52.457
I don't know yet.

00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:54.084
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:57.379
Have a shower.

00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:00.519
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

00:22:00.591 --> 00:22:01.508
are coming for breakfast.

00:22:01.592 --> 00:22:03.594
Here? Why?

00:22:03.677 --> 00:22:04.821
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

00:22:04.845 --> 00:22:05.965
I haven't got time for this.

00:22:06.013 --> 00:22:07.681
It's getting serious, Bruce.

00:22:07.764 --> 00:22:10.851
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

00:22:10.934 --> 00:22:12.519
I don't care about that.

00:22:13.437 --> 00:22:14.313
Any of that.

00:22:14.396 --> 00:22:16.036
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

00:22:18.275 --> 00:22:21.403
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

00:22:21.486 --> 00:22:23.655
If I can't change things here,

00:22:24.197 --> 00:22:26.116
if I can't have an effect,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.827
then I don't care what happens to me.

00:22:28.911 --> 00:22:30.037
That's what I'm afraid of.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.746
Alfred, stop.

00:22:33.122 --> 00:22:34.582
You're not my father.

00:22:37.376 --> 00:22:38.794
I'm well aware.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.373
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

00:23:41.023 --> 00:23:42.608
Some fresh berries there.

00:23:49.782 --> 00:23:50.908
What are you doing?

00:23:51.284 --> 00:23:54.954
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

00:23:55.329 --> 00:23:59.250
This is actually quite elusive.

00:24:02.253 --> 00:24:03.921
Where'd you get those O's?

00:24:05.464 --> 00:24:08.259
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

00:24:08.342 --> 00:24:10.761
It only gives us H, E, I, I, S, and T.

00:24:10.845 --> 00:24:14.891
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

00:24:14.974 --> 00:24:16.350
see where it leads.

00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:19.270
That's interesting.

00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:21.647
Mr. Pennyworth?

00:24:22.023 --> 00:24:23.024
Yes, Dory?

00:24:23.357 --> 00:24:24.817
The accountants are here.

00:24:24.901 --> 00:24:26.736
See them in, please, Dory.

00:24:29.655 --> 00:24:31.866
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

00:24:31.949 --> 00:24:33.534
What do you mean?

00:24:33.618 --> 00:24:35.453
What if this is the whole key?

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.915
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

00:24:38.998 --> 00:24:41.101
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:42.293
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

00:24:42.376 --> 00:24:44.503
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

00:24:44.587 --> 00:24:46.422
I don't see how that's gonna...

00:24:48.966 --> 00:24:49.967
Oh.

00:25:03.773 --> 00:25:05.441
Damn.

00:25:05.608 --> 00:25:07.860
Yeah, he's got a car.

00:25:08.778 --> 00:25:11.155
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

00:25:11.239 --> 00:25:12.907
Where to even start?

00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:15.826
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:17.030
You don't trust me?

00:25:17.912 --> 00:25:19.538
You mean like you trust me?

00:25:19.622 --> 00:25:22.500
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

00:25:24.502 --> 00:25:25.628
There.

00:25:48.734 --> 00:25:50.027
What are we looking for?

00:25:50.653 --> 00:25:52.196
A USB port.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.406
USB?

00:26:00.496 --> 00:26:01.664
What?

00:26:07.044 --> 00:26:09.297
"Thumb" drive.

00:26:10.089 --> 00:26:11.716
Jesus.

00:26:15.344 --> 00:26:16.846
It's encrypted.

00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:21.559
Try this.

00:26:28.566 --> 00:26:30.943
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

00:26:39.827 --> 00:26:42.413
Oh, well, well, well.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.082
So much for family values.

00:26:45.249 --> 00:26:46.417
Who is she?

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.085
No idea.

00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:51.839
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

00:26:52.173 --> 00:26:53.973
I know who he is.

00:26:54.133 --> 00:26:55.134
What was that?

00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:59.722
Shit, shit! The drive.

00:27:00.473 --> 00:27:02.808
It sent out the photos from my account.

00:27:02.892 --> 00:27:05.436
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:07.605
Jesus.

00:27:07.688 --> 00:27:10.066
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:11.609
"He lies still."

00:27:11.817 --> 00:27:12.859
About her?

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.695
Maybe.

00:27:15.862 --> 00:27:17.739
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

00:27:17.822 --> 00:27:21.243
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

00:27:21.326 --> 00:27:23.453
Never get in there without a warrant.

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:26.873
Yeah.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.179
Know who I am?

00:27:42.514 --> 00:27:44.766
Yeah. I got an idea.

00:27:45.225 --> 00:27:46.643
I want to see the Penguin.

00:27:47.352 --> 00:27:49.604
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

00:27:54.985 --> 00:27:55.986
What's the problem?

00:27:56.069 --> 00:27:57.487
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

00:27:57.571 --> 00:27:59.739
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

00:27:59.823 --> 00:28:01.449
That's what I tried to tell him.

00:28:01.533 --> 00:28:03.827
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.870
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

00:28:07.163 --> 00:28:08.248
Mine or yours?

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.590
Get him!

00:28:17.632 --> 00:28:18.860
I saw that whole thing.

00:28:18.884 --> 00:28:20.093
He's over there!

00:28:20.176 --> 00:28:21.511
What is your problem?

00:29:04.179 --> 00:29:06.348
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

00:29:16.942 --> 00:29:18.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:29:18.485 --> 00:29:20.612
Take it easy, sweetheart.

00:29:20.695 --> 00:29:22.489
You looking for me?

00:29:23.198 --> 00:29:25.116
I see you met the twins.

00:29:26.076 --> 00:29:29.371
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

00:29:30.247 --> 00:29:31.748
I guess we both are.

00:29:33.792 --> 00:29:35.210
How you doing?

00:29:35.835 --> 00:29:37.254
I'm Oz.

00:29:42.801 --> 00:29:44.052
Who is she?

00:29:47.097 --> 00:29:49.015
I really don't know, chief.

00:29:49.724 --> 00:29:51.935
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

00:29:52.018 --> 00:29:53.395
but I wasn't rolling with them.

00:30:06.825 --> 00:30:07.826
It's okay, baby.

00:30:08.368 --> 00:30:12.163
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

00:30:37.898 --> 00:30:39.107
Thank you, honey.

00:30:45.614 --> 00:30:47.449
Here you go, champ.

00:30:47.532 --> 00:30:51.077
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

00:30:51.161 --> 00:30:52.954
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

00:30:53.455 --> 00:30:54.831
Is that the mayor?

00:30:54.915 --> 00:30:56.708
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

00:30:57.918 --> 00:30:59.211
Don't make me hurt you.

00:30:59.294 --> 00:31:03.465
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

00:31:03.548 --> 00:31:06.509
Yeah, I do. Do you?

00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:09.763
Look...

00:31:11.014 --> 00:31:13.808
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

00:31:14.643 --> 00:31:18.939
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.865
Tell you one thing.

00:31:31.034 --> 00:31:34.621
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

00:31:35.121 --> 00:31:37.624
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

00:31:40.877 --> 00:31:42.712
What? Too soon?

00:31:52.555 --> 00:31:54.932
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

00:32:04.233 --> 00:32:05.234
Taxi!

00:32:07.736 --> 00:32:08.737
Taxi!

00:32:27.506 --> 00:32:28.799
Hey, it's me.

00:32:30.092 --> 00:32:31.427
Baby, what's wrong?

00:32:32.094 --> 00:32:34.096
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

00:32:36.557 --> 00:32:37.975
On the news?

00:32:38.642 --> 00:32:41.937
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:43.731
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

00:32:44.899 --> 00:32:48.527
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

00:32:49.236 --> 00:32:51.864
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

00:32:52.781 --> 00:32:54.221
Uh...

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.494
God damn it.

00:33:17.473 --> 00:33:19.534
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:33:19.558 --> 00:33:21.435
<i>With a younger mystery woman.</i>

00:33:21.518 --> 00:33:24.355
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

00:33:57.805 --> 00:34:00.724
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

00:36:15.234 --> 00:36:16.674
You're pretty good at that.

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:50.310
Hey! Give me that.

00:36:53.938 --> 00:36:56.482
"Kosolov, Annika."

00:36:57.984 --> 00:37:00.069
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

00:37:00.153 --> 00:37:02.906
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

00:37:40.985 --> 00:37:43.613
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

00:37:43.696 --> 00:37:46.157
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

00:37:46.241 --> 00:37:47.676
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.452
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

00:37:49.535 --> 00:37:50.912
What does she know?

00:37:50.995 --> 00:37:53.182
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

00:37:53.206 --> 00:37:54.791
She did seem upset.

00:37:56.584 --> 00:37:58.086
Back at your place.

00:38:00.129 --> 00:38:01.631
Let's go talk to her.

00:38:27.824 --> 00:38:28.908
Anni!

00:38:30.201 --> 00:38:31.286

00:38:55.268 --> 00:38:58.104
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:01.733
Shit, they took my phone.

00:40:34.742 --> 00:40:36.661
The real club.

It's a mob hangout.

00:40:58.182 --> 00:40:59.392
Who?

00:40:59.976 --> 00:41:02.395
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.649
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

00:41:08.902 --> 00:41:10.445
You're gonna help me on this.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.571
For your friend.

00:41:23.165 --> 00:41:24.499
You got a lot of cats.

00:41:26.001 --> 00:41:27.920
I have a thing about strays.

00:41:32.049 --> 00:41:33.383
You're not safe here.

00:41:34.509 --> 00:41:35.677
I can take care of myself.

00:41:35.761 --> 00:41:38.555
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

00:41:38.639 --> 00:41:40.182
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

00:41:40.265 --> 00:41:43.518
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

00:41:43.602 --> 00:41:46.438
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

00:42:04.456 --> 00:42:07.626
He waited for him at the gym.

00:42:08.752 --> 00:42:10.796
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

00:42:10.879 --> 00:42:13.006
when no one else was around.

00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:15.551
There's a needle mark on his neck.

00:42:15.634 --> 00:42:17.594
Injected him with arsenic.

00:42:19.596 --> 00:42:20.931
Rat poison.

00:42:21.723 --> 00:42:23.308
Yeah.

00:42:23.475 --> 00:42:25.936
That seems to be his theme here.

00:42:26.478 --> 00:42:27.854
Look at this thing.

00:42:35.988 --> 00:42:37.739
It's a maze.

00:42:40.325 --> 00:42:43.620
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

00:42:46.373 --> 00:42:47.457
More symbols.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.545
It's another cipher.

00:42:51.628 --> 00:42:54.381
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

00:42:55.048 --> 00:42:57.634
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

00:42:57.718 --> 00:43:00.846
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

00:43:02.431 --> 00:43:03.765
I don't get it.

00:43:03.849 --> 00:43:06.226
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

00:43:07.144 --> 00:43:09.146
Looks like he got greedy.

00:43:09.229 --> 00:43:10.272
You kidding me?

00:43:10.355 --> 00:43:13.066
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:16.403
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

00:43:16.486 --> 00:43:18.697
Maybe he's not who you thought.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.284
You make it sound like he had it coming.

00:43:24.536 --> 00:43:25.996
He was a cop.

00:43:27.331 --> 00:43:28.624
Crossed a line.

00:43:59.863 --> 00:44:01.531
"I'm mad about you.

00:44:01.615 --> 00:44:05.285
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

00:44:12.417 --> 00:44:15.504
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

00:44:15.671 --> 00:44:19.258
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:21.051
The hell is that?

00:44:21.802 --> 00:44:24.972
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

00:44:26.098 --> 00:44:27.599
I don't know.

00:44:28.475 --> 00:44:29.643
Lieutenant.

00:44:29.726 --> 00:44:31.144
They're coming back.

00:44:31.228 --> 00:44:32.628
We got to get out of here.

00:44:36.567 --> 00:44:37.776
Come on.

00:44:42.864 --> 00:44:43.907
Ow!

00:44:45.367 --> 00:44:46.702
I don't know about these things.

00:44:46.785 --> 00:44:50.247
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

00:44:54.251 --> 00:44:56.837
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

00:44:58.714 --> 00:45:00.173
I'm just looking for Annika.

00:45:04.469 --> 00:45:06.096
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

00:45:07.222 --> 00:45:09.850
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

00:45:19.401 --> 00:45:20.611
Look at me.

00:45:30.245 --> 00:45:32.414
Looks good. Here.

00:46:15.581 --> 00:46:17.583
I got you. Can you hear me?

00:46:18.543 --> 00:46:19.544
Yeah.

00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:29.220
Hey, where you goin'?

00:46:29.845 --> 00:46:30.972
Hospitality.

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:34.559
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

00:46:36.352 --> 00:46:37.853
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

00:46:44.527 --> 00:46:46.612
"Kenzie, William."

00:46:46.696 --> 00:46:48.155
He's an off-duty cop.

00:46:50.032 --> 00:46:52.010
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

00:46:52.034 --> 00:46:54.078
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

00:47:10.636 --> 00:47:13.764
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

00:47:13.848 --> 00:47:14.974
Great.

00:47:22.231 --> 00:47:24.585
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

00:47:24.609 --> 00:47:26.193
Feels good, doesn't it?

00:47:26.277 --> 00:47:28.487
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

00:47:34.535 --> 00:47:36.162
<i>Jesus, I hate drop heads.</i>

00:47:36.245 --> 00:47:37.288
Really?

00:47:37.371 --> 00:47:38.390
'Cause when I first saw you,

00:47:38.414 --> 00:47:39.683
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

00:47:39.707 --> 00:47:41.959
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

00:47:42.585 --> 00:47:44.337
Can we not do this right now?

00:47:46.255 --> 00:47:47.798
Wait. Who was that?

00:47:47.882 --> 00:47:49.050
Oh, I saw him.

00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:50.218
<i>Look back.</i>

00:47:50.301 --> 00:47:52.154
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

00:47:52.178 --> 00:47:53.512
I need to see his face.

00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:56.641
Jesus.

00:48:04.649 --> 00:48:05.816
That's the DA.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.943
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

00:48:07.026 --> 00:48:08.694
And he's coming over. You happy?

00:48:08.778 --> 00:48:09.987
<i>Talk to him.</i>

00:48:13.115 --> 00:48:14.200
Hey. How you doing?

00:48:14.283 --> 00:48:15.368
Hi.

00:48:15.451 --> 00:48:16.451
I'm Gil.

00:48:17.495 --> 00:48:19.121
Hey, aren't you the DA?

00:48:19.205 --> 00:48:20.205
Yeah.

00:48:20.373 --> 00:48:22.542
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

00:48:22.625 --> 00:48:24.001
Is that right?

00:48:24.418 --> 00:48:26.629
I haven't seen you around here before.

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.674
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

00:48:29.757 --> 00:48:32.301
'cause people are all a little on edge.

00:48:32.385 --> 00:48:33.945
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:35.239
<i>Is that right?</i>

00:48:35.263 --> 00:48:36.472
<i>I like that.</i>

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:37.890
Do you want to come over?

00:48:37.974 --> 00:48:39.100
Sure.

00:48:42.103 --> 00:48:43.437
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

00:48:43.521 --> 00:48:45.081
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

00:48:45.231 --> 00:48:47.108
<i>- Richie, Glen.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

00:48:48.568 --> 00:48:50.069
That's half the DA's office.

00:48:50.152 --> 00:48:51.380
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

00:48:51.404 --> 00:48:52.404
Hi.

00:48:52.446 --> 00:48:54.550
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

00:48:54.574 --> 00:48:56.450
Drowning our sorrows.

00:48:56.784 --> 00:48:58.077
<i>You want a drop?</i>

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.204
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

00:49:02.164 --> 00:49:03.833
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

00:49:03.916 --> 00:49:06.276
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

00:49:06.419 --> 00:49:07.419
He's wasted.

00:49:07.461 --> 00:49:08.504
No shit.

00:49:10.172 --> 00:49:11.292
<i>I like this girl.</i>

00:49:11.632 --> 00:49:13.217
Oh, hey, I like you too!

00:49:16.762 --> 00:49:20.099
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

00:49:20.182 --> 00:49:21.267
<i>He knows so much.</i>

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:22.703
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

00:49:22.727 --> 00:49:25.038
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:25.980
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:28.041
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:30.026
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

00:49:32.028 --> 00:49:33.863
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

00:49:44.207 --> 00:49:45.416
<i>I mean...</i>

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:49.837
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

00:49:50.421 --> 00:49:52.840
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

00:49:52.924 --> 00:49:54.693
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

00:49:54.717 --> 00:49:56.302
He's talking about the Maroni case.

00:49:56.385 --> 00:49:59.680
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

00:50:00.264 --> 00:50:02.558
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

00:50:02.642 --> 00:50:04.560
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

00:50:04.644 --> 00:50:07.331
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

00:50:07.355 --> 00:50:08.606
What do you know about that?

00:50:10.233 --> 00:50:11.400
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

00:50:11.484 --> 00:50:12.484
<i>I want a drink.</i>

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:13.861
Keep him talking.

00:50:16.948 --> 00:50:18.032
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:19.158
She knows Annika.

00:50:19.242 --> 00:50:20.660
No, stay on the DA.

00:50:20.743 --> 00:50:22.662
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:26.916
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

00:50:26.999 --> 00:50:28.101
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:30.729
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

00:50:30.753 --> 00:50:32.004
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

00:50:32.088 --> 00:50:34.548
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:37.551
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:39.195
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

00:50:39.219 --> 00:50:40.303
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

00:50:45.058 --> 00:50:46.101
<i>Hey.</i>

00:50:46.685 --> 00:50:47.769
Hey.

00:50:48.937 --> 00:50:52.107
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.609
How you been?

00:50:56.945 --> 00:50:58.655
Yeah, I've been okay.

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.366
<i>I was just...</i>

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.245
I was just headed back upstairs.

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:06.997
Well...

00:51:08.081 --> 00:51:09.749
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:26.224
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

00:51:26.308 --> 00:51:27.952
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

00:51:27.976 --> 00:51:29.769
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:31.747
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

00:51:31.771 --> 00:51:32.856
Wait, what are you doing?

00:51:32.939 --> 00:51:35.358
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

00:51:39.946 --> 00:51:40.947
Taxi!

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:45.911
Hey!

00:51:47.621 --> 00:51:48.705
I lost you in there.

00:51:48.788 --> 00:51:49.873
Yeah, I gotta go.

00:51:50.749 --> 00:51:52.167
Oh, you need a ride?

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.169
That's me right there.

00:52:00.258 --> 00:52:01.343
Taxi!

00:52:01.426 --> 00:52:02.552
I'm good.

00:52:04.262 --> 00:52:05.680
I hope, uh...

00:52:10.268 --> 00:52:11.686
I'll see you around.

00:53:38.356 --> 00:53:42.152
Just hold still.

00:54:40.502 --> 00:54:41.419
What do you know about

00:54:41.503 --> 00:54:43.797
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:48.593
Yeah, sure, there was.

00:54:49.302 --> 00:54:51.137
That's the rat we're looking for.

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:53.932
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

00:54:54.516 --> 00:54:57.519
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

00:54:57.602 --> 00:54:59.062
Where are you getting this?

00:54:59.145 --> 00:55:02.023
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

00:55:02.816 --> 00:55:04.276
Gil's very nervous.

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:07.779
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

00:55:07.862 --> 00:55:09.739
I worked that case.

00:55:09.823 --> 00:55:11.783
Riddler's not after you.

00:55:11.866 --> 00:55:12.866
How do you know?

00:55:13.158 --> 00:55:14.577
You're not corrupt.

00:55:15.619 --> 00:55:17.162
Colson's dirty?

00:55:23.043 --> 00:55:24.545
Maybe I, uh...

00:55:25.212 --> 00:55:28.549
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

00:55:28.632 --> 00:55:31.927
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

00:55:32.678 --> 00:55:34.471
Who knows how many people it touches.

00:55:34.555 --> 00:55:37.766
Politicians. Police. The courts.

00:55:39.059 --> 00:55:40.769
It could tear the whole city apart.

00:55:41.186 --> 00:55:43.230
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

00:55:44.857 --> 00:55:46.609
And Riddler's the match.

00:55:47.484 --> 00:55:48.712
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

00:55:48.736 --> 00:55:50.088
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

00:55:50.112 --> 00:55:51.590
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:51.614 --> 00:55:53.174
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

00:55:54.158 --> 00:55:55.802
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:55.826 --> 00:55:57.596
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:00.080
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

00:56:00.164 --> 00:56:01.266
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:02.976
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.895
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

00:56:04.919 --> 00:56:06.399
Pretty.

00:56:08.172 --> 00:56:09.548
She a new friend of yours?

00:56:14.136 --> 00:56:15.346
I'm not so sure.

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.681
Looks like you upset her.

00:56:18.849 --> 00:56:20.976
Shall I take this as a good sign?

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.061
What?

00:56:22.144 --> 00:56:23.062
Your attire.

00:56:23.145 --> 00:56:25.272
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

00:56:25.356 --> 00:56:27.358
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

00:56:27.441 --> 00:56:30.110
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

00:56:31.153 --> 00:56:32.738
Riddler might not be able to resist.

00:56:32.821 --> 00:56:34.281
Oh, that reminds me.

00:56:35.449 --> 00:56:39.411
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

00:56:39.954 --> 00:56:41.455
The one from the rat maze.

00:56:41.872 --> 00:56:44.959
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

00:56:45.292 --> 00:56:47.169
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

00:56:47.253 --> 00:56:50.506
"You are <i>El Rata A lad a."</i>

00:56:51.131 --> 00:56:52.550
<i>Rata A lad a?</i>

00:56:52.633 --> 00:56:53.842
"Rat with wings"?

00:56:53.926 --> 00:56:56.428
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

00:56:56.512 --> 00:56:57.763
Yeah.

00:56:59.223 --> 00:57:00.349
A stool pigeon.

00:57:00.599 --> 00:57:02.226
Where are your cufflinks?

00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:03.309
I couldn't find them.

00:57:04.728 --> 00:57:06.689
Well, you can't go out like that.

00:57:06.772 --> 00:57:08.566
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

00:57:12.736 --> 00:57:15.531
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

00:57:17.241 --> 00:57:19.451
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

00:57:20.452 --> 00:57:22.246
Your father gave them to me.

00:57:28.002 --> 00:57:31.130
No more lies! No more lies!

00:57:49.315 --> 00:57:52.276
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:06.582
Is that Bruce Wayne?

00:58:06.665 --> 00:58:09.293
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

00:58:18.385 --> 00:58:19.386
Hold it.

00:58:20.721 --> 00:58:21.972
You good, fellas?

00:58:22.556 --> 00:58:23.557
Good.

00:58:25.684 --> 00:58:26.769
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

00:58:44.578 --> 00:58:45.579
Sir?

00:59:05.266 --> 00:59:06.266
Hey!

00:59:06.308 --> 00:59:08.310
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:11.105
Hey, watch it, fellas.

00:59:11.564 --> 00:59:13.857
You got the prince of the city there.

00:59:16.694 --> 00:59:18.529
Some event, huh?

00:59:18.612 --> 00:59:21.574
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

00:59:21.657 --> 00:59:24.118
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:25.887
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

00:59:25.911 --> 00:59:27.913
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:30.207
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:32.293
Wow. Is that right?

00:59:32.376 --> 00:59:34.420
His father saved my life.

00:59:35.379 --> 00:59:38.591
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.304
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

00:59:43.596 --> 00:59:46.807
Operated right on the dining room table.

00:59:46.891 --> 00:59:52.146
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

00:59:53.563 --> 00:59:55.565
I remember your face.

00:59:57.567 --> 00:59:59.527
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

00:59:59.903 --> 01:00:02.030
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

01:00:03.364 --> 01:00:04.949
"Hippocratic oath."

01:00:07.493 --> 01:00:08.703
That's good.

01:00:09.245 --> 01:00:10.413
Excuse me.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Yes.

01:00:29.015 --> 01:00:30.159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:00:30.183 --> 01:00:31.827
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

01:00:31.851 --> 01:00:34.229
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

01:00:34.312 --> 01:00:36.105
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

01:00:36.189 --> 01:00:37.629
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:39.168
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

01:00:39.192 --> 01:00:40.610
<i>consider a donation to</i>

01:00:40.693 --> 01:00:42.737
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.073
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

01:00:45.156 --> 01:00:46.366
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

01:00:46.741 --> 01:00:49.285
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:54.123
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

01:00:54.207 --> 01:00:57.418
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

01:00:58.419 --> 01:01:00.296
He got what he deserved.

01:01:02.215 --> 01:01:03.216
Know what I mean?

01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:06.636
Hey, don't I know you?

01:01:06.719 --> 01:01:07.804
Bruce Wayne.

01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:10.682
Why haven't you called me back?

01:01:10.765 --> 01:01:11.766
I'm sorry?

01:01:12.058 --> 01:01:14.394
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

01:01:14.477 --> 01:01:15.746
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:18.439
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

01:01:18.523 --> 01:01:19.857
Will you walk with me?

01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:26.364
Mr. Wayne.

01:01:26.447 --> 01:01:27.657
Mr. Wayne.

01:01:28.366 --> 01:01:31.452
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:33.872
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

01:01:33.955 --> 01:01:36.374
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

01:01:36.457 --> 01:01:38.918
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

01:01:39.502 --> 01:01:40.795
Thank you.

01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:42.672
My God.

01:01:44.507 --> 01:01:47.010
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

01:01:47.093 --> 01:01:48.720
I want to continue this.

01:01:52.932 --> 01:01:53.932
Excuse me.

01:01:55.852 --> 01:01:57.729
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:01:59.939 --> 01:02:00.857
Thank you.

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.700
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

01:02:04.027 --> 01:02:05.904
Gil Colson is missing.

01:02:05.987 --> 01:02:07.280
What?

01:02:07.363 --> 01:02:09.657
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

01:02:09.741 --> 01:02:10.783
Christ, not again.

01:02:10.867 --> 01:02:12.952
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

01:02:15.246 --> 01:02:17.290
You got people looking for him, Jim?

01:02:17.957 --> 01:02:20.251
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

01:02:20.335 --> 01:02:21.252
What'd his wife say?

01:02:21.336 --> 01:02:22.736
She hadn't heard from him.

01:03:17.308 --> 01:03:18.428
Get out of the car!

01:03:18.977 --> 01:03:21.187
Get out of the car and show your hands!

01:03:22.605 --> 01:03:23.815
Get out!

01:03:34.325 --> 01:03:35.618
Get 'em up!

01:03:35.702 --> 01:03:37.453
Get out! Show 'em!

01:03:41.916 --> 01:03:43.501
Christ, it's Colson.

01:03:43.585 --> 01:03:45.295
There's a bomb around his neck!

01:04:00.351 --> 01:04:01.895
Let's clear this place out now!

01:04:01.978 --> 01:04:04.018
We've got to get this place cleared out!

01:04:37.846 --> 01:04:40.599
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

01:04:43.602 --> 01:04:45.202
We don't know if he's in on it.

01:04:48.148 --> 01:04:49.483
What's he looking at?

01:05:08.252 --> 01:05:09.586
Holy shit.

01:05:10.629 --> 01:05:12.297
Are you kidding me?

01:05:12.381 --> 01:05:15.133
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

01:05:15.968 --> 01:05:18.428
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

01:05:34.194 --> 01:05:35.404
Please.

01:05:35.571 --> 01:05:38.323
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.010
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

01:05:41.034 --> 01:05:42.035
I'm so sorry.

01:05:42.536 --> 01:05:44.204
Looks like a combination lock.

01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:45.747
Can't we just cut it off?

01:05:46.498 --> 01:05:48.166
Not if you want to keep your head.

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:26.121
<i>You came.</i>

01:06:27.956 --> 01:06:29.041
Who are you?

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:30.584
<i>Me?</i>

01:06:33.003 --> 01:06:34.588
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

01:06:36.048 --> 01:06:38.467
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:42.846
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

01:06:43.388 --> 01:06:44.473
"Unmask"?

01:06:44.556 --> 01:06:45.724
<i>Yes.</i>

01:06:46.558 --> 01:06:49.394
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

01:06:49.478 --> 01:06:51.897
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

01:06:52.564 --> 01:06:54.900
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

01:06:54.983 --> 01:06:56.777
How am I a part of this?

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.779
<i>You'll see.</i>

01:06:58.862 --> 01:07:00.673
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

01:07:00.697 --> 01:07:02.783
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

01:07:02.866 --> 01:07:04.117
<i>We're live.</i>

01:07:04.201 --> 01:07:07.204
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

01:07:08.413 --> 01:07:09.581
<i>At the moment,</i>

01:07:09.665 --> 01:07:13.043
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

01:07:13.126 --> 01:07:14.169
<i>is dead.</i>

01:07:14.253 --> 01:07:16.314
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

01:07:16.338 --> 01:07:17.338
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:20.509
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

01:07:20.592 --> 01:07:23.595
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:07:23.679 --> 01:07:24.680
Okay.

01:07:33.438 --> 01:07:35.524
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

01:07:37.276 --> 01:07:39.444
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

01:07:41.488 --> 01:07:42.531
<i>Now,</i>

01:07:43.532 --> 01:07:46.326
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:49.997
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

01:07:50.581 --> 01:07:53.000
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:56.420
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

01:07:56.503 --> 01:08:01.717
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.052
You want me to do puzzles?

01:08:04.136 --> 01:08:06.889
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

01:08:06.972 --> 01:08:11.059
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

01:08:11.143 --> 01:08:13.478
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

01:08:13.562 --> 01:08:15.731
Okay, okay. So I just...

01:08:15.814 --> 01:08:17.000
You want me to...

01:08:17.024 --> 01:08:19.359
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:23.071
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

01:08:23.155 --> 01:08:27.826
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:30.329
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

01:08:30.412 --> 01:08:31.496
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.998
- "Justice."
- Huh?

01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:34.124
The answer's "justice."

01:08:34.208 --> 01:08:35.417
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.085
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

01:08:37.169 --> 01:08:41.506
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:43.967
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

01:08:44.051 --> 01:08:46.428
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

01:08:46.511 --> 01:08:47.780
Of course, of course. Of course.

01:08:47.804 --> 01:08:50.182
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:54.394
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

01:08:54.478 --> 01:08:58.649
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

01:08:58.732 --> 01:09:00.525
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:01.860
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

01:09:01.944 --> 01:09:04.172
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:06.716
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.991
- How much?
- Nothing!

01:09:08.075 --> 01:09:10.285
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

01:09:10.369 --> 01:09:12.722
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

01:09:12.746 --> 01:09:13.580
What cases?

01:09:13.664 --> 01:09:14.789
He didn't ask me that!

01:09:14.872 --> 01:09:16.308
Come on! Ten grand.

01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:19.293
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

01:09:19.377 --> 01:09:22.004
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

01:09:22.088 --> 01:09:25.925
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

01:09:26.008 --> 01:09:28.427
<i>Last riddle.</i>

01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:32.848
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

01:09:32.932 --> 01:09:37.228
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

01:09:37.311 --> 01:09:39.397
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.024
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

01:09:42.108 --> 01:09:43.961
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

01:09:43.985 --> 01:09:45.194
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

01:09:45.278 --> 01:09:46.946
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:49.049
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

01:09:49.073 --> 01:09:50.616
If I go out this way, it's just me.

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.828
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

01:09:53.911 --> 01:09:55.371
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

01:09:55.454 --> 01:09:56.849
- People are watching.
- What people?

01:09:56.873 --> 01:09:59.000
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:01.252
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

01:10:01.335 --> 01:10:02.211
<i>Four!</i>

01:10:02.295 --> 01:10:03.730
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

01:10:03.754 --> 01:10:05.631
<i>Goodbye!</i>

01:10:35.828 --> 01:10:37.264
Who do you think he is under there?

01:10:37.288 --> 01:10:38.122
Take it easy.

01:10:38.206 --> 01:10:39.207
I want to see.

01:10:40.541 --> 01:10:41.981
What is that thing? Leather?

01:10:45.504 --> 01:10:46.964
What's he got on his eyes?

01:10:47.048 --> 01:10:48.567
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

01:10:48.591 --> 01:10:49.860
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

01:10:49.884 --> 01:10:51.364
Hey!

01:10:51.636 --> 01:10:54.764
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:10:54.847 --> 01:10:56.515
Relax, God damn it!

01:10:56.599 --> 01:10:58.100
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

01:10:59.518 --> 01:11:02.063
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

01:11:02.146 --> 01:11:04.565
Colson's blood is on his hands.

01:11:04.649 --> 01:11:06.067
Maybe it's on yours.

01:11:07.526 --> 01:11:08.569
What'd you say?

01:11:08.653 --> 01:11:10.238
He would rather die than talk.

01:11:10.821 --> 01:11:12.323
What was he afraid of?

01:11:13.074 --> 01:11:14.158
You?

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:22.708
You son of a bitch.

01:11:23.292 --> 01:11:26.295
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

01:11:26.379 --> 01:11:28.089
You could be an accessory to murder.

01:11:28.172 --> 01:11:29.274
Why are we playing games...

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.176
Get him! Come on!

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.262
Back off! Back off!

01:11:34.345 --> 01:11:36.639
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

01:11:36.722 --> 01:11:38.808
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

01:11:38.891 --> 01:11:41.686
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

01:11:44.355 --> 01:11:45.898
You too now?

01:11:45.982 --> 01:11:48.526
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

01:11:48.609 --> 01:11:51.195
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

01:11:51.279 --> 01:11:53.531
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

01:11:56.325 --> 01:11:57.827
Okay, give him the room.

01:12:13.467 --> 01:12:14.760
Two minutes.

01:12:26.522 --> 01:12:28.107
You listen to me.

01:12:29.692 --> 01:12:31.694
We gotta get you out of here.

01:12:33.362 --> 01:12:35.323
That would put a lot of heat on you.

01:12:35.406 --> 01:12:37.074
Well, you punched me in the face.

01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:40.620
Take this key.

01:12:41.913 --> 01:12:45.291
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:48.094
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

01:12:49.045 --> 01:12:51.339
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

01:12:54.717 --> 01:12:57.094
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

01:13:00.514 --> 01:13:03.226
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

01:13:03.309 --> 01:13:06.229
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

01:13:07.146 --> 01:13:09.774
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

01:13:12.485 --> 01:13:14.445
Or he moonlights as a cop.

01:13:19.033 --> 01:13:20.593
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

01:13:20.618 --> 01:13:22.119
Somebody stop him!

01:14:00.323 --> 01:14:02.203
- There he is!
- Freeze!

01:14:48.246 --> 01:14:50.286
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

01:14:50.707 --> 01:14:51.917
I did.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.378
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

01:14:55.462 --> 01:14:57.505
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

01:14:57.589 --> 01:14:58.715
I only trust you.

01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:01.134
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

01:15:01.218 --> 01:15:04.596
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

01:15:05.347 --> 01:15:06.473
You think Penguin's the rat?

01:15:06.556 --> 01:15:09.601
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

01:15:09.684 --> 01:15:11.645
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

01:15:11.728 --> 01:15:13.063
DA was a regular too.

01:15:13.146 --> 01:15:16.650
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

01:15:17.734 --> 01:15:18.944
The <i>Rata A lad a.</i>

01:15:19.027 --> 01:15:20.027
The what?

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:21.529
Riddler's latest.

01:15:21.613 --> 01:15:23.323
The cipher in the maze.

01:15:23.406 --> 01:15:25.909
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

01:15:27.494 --> 01:15:29.120
A penguin's got wings too.

01:15:31.122 --> 01:15:33.083
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

01:15:33.166 --> 01:15:34.894
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

01:15:34.918 --> 01:15:38.129
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

01:15:38.213 --> 01:15:41.383
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:46.210
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

01:15:47.013 --> 01:15:48.098
There's Penguin.

01:15:48.181 --> 01:15:50.058
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

01:15:51.685 --> 01:15:52.936
<i>You want to move in?</i>

01:15:54.813 --> 01:15:56.273
<i>Let's follow.</i>

01:16:14.791 --> 01:16:18.336
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

01:16:18.461 --> 01:16:19.713
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:16:21.131 --> 01:16:22.859
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

01:16:22.883 --> 01:16:25.385
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

01:16:44.613 --> 01:16:47.157
It's a drug lab. Drops.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.450
This is a buy.

01:16:48.533 --> 01:16:51.703
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

01:16:51.786 --> 01:16:53.014
Or they never shut it down at all.

01:16:53.038 --> 01:16:53.914
<i>What are you saying?</i>

01:16:53.997 --> 01:16:57.125
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

01:17:21.483 --> 01:17:22.901
This just got complicated.

01:17:23.652 --> 01:17:24.819
What do you mean?

01:17:30.742 --> 01:17:32.202
Hey! What happened?

01:17:32.285 --> 01:17:33.620
You all right?

01:17:44.339 --> 01:17:46.132
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

01:17:46.258 --> 01:17:47.884
Jesus.

01:17:48.635 --> 01:17:50.470
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

01:17:50.971 --> 01:17:52.305
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

01:17:52.389 --> 01:17:54.099
Is that why you work in the club?

01:17:54.849 --> 01:17:55.892
It was all just a score?

01:17:55.976 --> 01:17:59.771
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

01:18:01.147 --> 01:18:03.066
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

01:18:14.369 --> 01:18:15.369
Jesus!

01:18:43.939 --> 01:18:45.065
Hey, Vengeance!

01:18:47.234 --> 01:18:49.945
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

01:19:30.819 --> 01:19:32.446
Kenzie! Get the money!

01:19:37.868 --> 01:19:39.119
Hey! What the...

01:20:29.753 --> 01:20:31.088
Whoa!

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.885
Come on! Come on!

01:20:39.054 --> 01:20:40.389
This guy's crazy!

01:20:42.141 --> 01:20:43.851
Come on! Hey!

01:21:33.317 --> 01:21:34.318
Move!

01:22:39.133 --> 01:22:41.010
Get out of the way!

01:22:52.146 --> 01:22:53.230
Come on!

01:23:01.947 --> 01:23:03.073
Get out of the way!

01:23:40.318 --> 01:23:42.362
I got you!

01:23:43.613 --> 01:23:44.948
I got you!

01:23:45.031 --> 01:23:47.367
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:48.910
I got you!

01:25:05.361 --> 01:25:08.198
What the hell is this?
Good cop, bat shit cop?

01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:10.909
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

01:25:10.992 --> 01:25:12.344
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

01:25:12.368 --> 01:25:13.786
Cops caught you doing something.

01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:15.556
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.457
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.667
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

01:25:19.751 --> 01:25:20.960
His drops operation.

01:25:21.044 --> 01:25:23.504
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

01:25:23.588 --> 01:25:27.217
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:29.111
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

01:25:29.135 --> 01:25:31.471
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

01:25:31.554 --> 01:25:34.766
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

01:25:34.849 --> 01:25:36.017
What are you, crazy?

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:37.244
That why you killed the girl?

01:25:37.268 --> 01:25:38.268
I didn't kill no girl!

01:25:38.311 --> 01:25:40.104
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

01:25:40.188 --> 01:25:41.481
But she got too close, right?

01:25:41.564 --> 01:25:43.834
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

01:25:43.858 --> 01:25:45.818
But somehow Riddler found out too.

01:25:45.902 --> 01:25:47.820
He knows so much about you.

01:25:47.904 --> 01:25:49.948
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

01:25:50.532 --> 01:25:52.742
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

01:25:53.159 --> 01:25:54.439
Why don't you start harmonizing?

01:25:54.661 --> 01:25:57.330
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

01:25:57.413 --> 01:25:58.748
I ain't no rat!

01:25:58.831 --> 01:26:00.726
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:01.894
if he heard this kind of talk?

01:26:01.918 --> 01:26:04.087
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:06.714
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

01:26:06.798 --> 01:26:08.358
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

01:26:08.424 --> 01:26:10.051
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

01:26:10.134 --> 01:26:12.053
Open your eyes!

01:26:15.974 --> 01:26:17.559
Are you <i>El Rata A lad a?</i>

01:26:17.642 --> 01:26:19.143
<i>El Rata A lad a?</i>

01:26:19.227 --> 01:26:21.062
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

01:26:21.145 --> 01:26:23.481
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

01:26:23.565 --> 01:26:26.150
It says you are <i>El Rata A lad a.</i>

01:26:26.234 --> 01:26:27.610
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

01:26:27.694 --> 01:26:28.963
Why, you got something to tell us?

01:26:28.987 --> 01:26:29.987
Yeah!

01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:31.632
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

01:26:31.656 --> 01:26:32.656
What?

01:26:32.907 --> 01:26:34.242
It's <i>"La."</i>

01:26:34.325 --> 01:26:35.618
<i>"La" rata.</i>

01:26:36.119 --> 01:26:38.121
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

01:26:38.204 --> 01:26:40.081
Jesus! Look at you two.

01:26:40.498 --> 01:26:42.750
World's greatest detectives!

01:26:43.167 --> 01:26:45.521
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

01:26:45.545 --> 01:26:46.629
Jesus!

01:26:46.713 --> 01:26:48.214
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

01:26:48.298 --> 01:26:50.300
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

01:26:51.718 --> 01:26:52.838
You think he made a mistake?

01:26:52.886 --> 01:26:54.095
He doesn't make mistakes.

01:26:54.178 --> 01:26:55.221
A rat with wings?

01:26:55.305 --> 01:26:56.890
You know what that sounds like to me?

01:26:56.973 --> 01:27:00.143
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

01:27:00.226 --> 01:27:02.228
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

01:27:07.859 --> 01:27:11.738
"You are <i>el."</i>

01:27:20.413 --> 01:27:21.915
Maybe it was a mistake.

01:27:22.332 --> 01:27:23.166
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

01:27:23.249 --> 01:27:24.249
Wait.

01:27:27.503 --> 01:27:28.838
Is that him?

01:27:29.714 --> 01:27:31.549
Holy shit.

01:27:51.444 --> 01:27:53.324
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

01:28:22.432 --> 01:28:26.061
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

01:28:26.144 --> 01:28:28.981
But in a mansion, in a slum,

01:28:29.064 --> 01:28:30.983
I'll never know where I come from.

01:28:31.858 --> 01:28:33.193
Do you know what I am?"

01:28:33.277 --> 01:28:34.278
Any idea?

01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.821
Yeah.

01:28:37.239 --> 01:28:38.490
It's an orphan.

01:28:47.374 --> 01:28:49.126
A mansion in a slum.

01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:53.309
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

01:28:53.338 --> 01:28:55.048
It was part of the Wayne estate.

01:28:55.674 --> 01:28:57.318
They donated it
after they built the tower.

01:28:57.342 --> 01:28:58.342
Let's go.

01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:03.891
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

01:29:04.933 --> 01:29:06.310
You gonna untie me?

01:29:06.393 --> 01:29:08.193
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

01:29:11.773 --> 01:29:12.774
Hey!

01:29:14.234 --> 01:29:16.653
You goddamn sons of bitches!

01:29:30.751 --> 01:29:32.920
No guns.

01:29:34.379 --> 01:29:36.423
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

01:29:57.528 --> 01:29:58.737
What's that?

01:30:09.248 --> 01:30:11.166
Hey! Hey!

01:30:17.631 --> 01:30:18.840
Drop heads.

01:30:26.265 --> 01:30:27.891
What the hell is that?

01:30:39.653 --> 01:30:42.030
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

01:30:42.114 --> 01:30:43.407
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:48.203
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.205
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

01:30:51.957 --> 01:30:53.542
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

01:30:54.835 --> 01:30:56.628
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

01:30:57.838 --> 01:31:01.300
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

01:31:01.842 --> 01:31:03.635
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

01:31:03.719 --> 01:31:06.555
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

01:31:06.638 --> 01:31:09.975
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

01:31:10.517 --> 01:31:12.394
<i>Win or lose,</i>

01:31:12.477 --> 01:31:15.272
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

01:31:15.731 --> 01:31:18.567
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

01:31:19.151 --> 01:31:23.197
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.199
<i>who need it now,</i>

01:31:25.282 --> 01:31:26.742
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

01:31:26.825 --> 01:31:28.243
"Sins of the father."

01:31:28.327 --> 01:31:30.787
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

01:31:33.248 --> 01:31:35.334
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

01:31:39.213 --> 01:31:41.423
Shall be visited upon the son.

01:31:43.425 --> 01:31:46.553
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

01:31:51.141 --> 01:31:52.559
Hey!

01:32:52.243 --> 01:32:54.787
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

01:32:54.871 --> 01:32:56.706
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

01:32:56.789 --> 01:32:58.416
Something terrible is gonna happen!

01:32:59.083 --> 01:33:01.168
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

01:33:12.972 --> 01:33:14.724
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

01:33:15.892 --> 01:33:17.560
I'm so sorry.

01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:20.771
I've been trying to reach you.

01:33:23.524 --> 01:33:25.284
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

01:33:25.735 --> 01:33:29.488
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.846
We've sedated him.

01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:55.556
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

01:33:56.432 --> 01:33:59.143
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

01:33:59.685 --> 01:34:01.437
Is there anyone else to notify?

01:34:02.772 --> 01:34:04.190
Next of kin?

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.404
No.

01:34:11.531 --> 01:34:13.157
It's just me.

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.511
Selina?

01:36:04.143 --> 01:36:05.144
<i>Can you see me?</i>

01:36:08.272 --> 01:36:10.691
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

01:36:11.567 --> 01:36:12.652
<i>Where can we go?</i>

01:36:31.337 --> 01:36:33.256
Cat burglar pulling another score?

01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.801
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

01:36:36.884 --> 01:36:39.345
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

01:36:40.012 --> 01:36:41.764
How could they do that to her?

01:36:41.847 --> 01:36:43.808
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

01:36:43.891 --> 01:36:45.810
Her body was in his car.

01:36:45.893 --> 01:36:48.771
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

01:36:48.854 --> 01:36:51.857
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

01:36:51.941 --> 01:36:53.544
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

01:36:53.568 --> 01:36:55.194
She didn't know any better.

01:36:55.278 --> 01:36:56.672
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

01:36:56.696 --> 01:36:58.256
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:36:58.322 --> 01:36:59.883
It means your choices have consequences.

01:36:59.907 --> 01:37:02.285
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

01:37:02.368 --> 01:37:05.079
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

01:37:05.162 --> 01:37:06.998
- Was it worth it?
- What?

01:37:07.331 --> 01:37:09.500
Compromising yourself for money?

01:37:10.877 --> 01:37:13.129
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

01:37:14.755 --> 01:37:18.425
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

01:37:18.508 --> 01:37:19.902
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:37:19.926 --> 01:37:21.261
Falcone owes me that money.

01:37:21.344 --> 01:37:23.096
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

01:37:23.179 --> 01:37:24.014
Oh, really? Why's that?

01:37:24.097 --> 01:37:25.015
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

01:37:25.098 --> 01:37:26.850
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

01:37:26.933 --> 01:37:27.934
would owe you anything.

01:37:28.018 --> 01:37:30.353
Because he's my father!

01:37:39.487 --> 01:37:42.282
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

01:37:43.783 --> 01:37:45.076
Just like Anni.

01:37:47.245 --> 01:37:49.789
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

01:37:51.875 --> 01:37:53.210
To the club?

01:37:54.127 --> 01:37:55.128
Yeah.

01:37:57.839 --> 01:38:00.717
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

01:38:01.176 --> 01:38:02.928
Used to see him there.

01:38:03.678 --> 01:38:05.680
He scared the shit out of me.

01:38:07.641 --> 01:38:11.102
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

01:38:11.645 --> 01:38:15.482
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.196
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

01:38:21.863 --> 01:38:23.365
Strangled.

01:38:23.782 --> 01:38:27.244
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.206
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

01:38:31.289 --> 01:38:33.458
and he didn't say a thing.

01:38:35.293 --> 01:38:37.087
Couldn't even look at me.

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.592
He owes me that money.

01:38:44.386 --> 01:38:45.804
I'm sorry.

01:38:46.930 --> 01:38:48.098
For what I said.

01:38:49.474 --> 01:38:50.892
Oh, it's all right.

01:38:54.437 --> 01:38:56.523
You assume the worst in people.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.817
Which, well...

01:39:01.111 --> 01:39:03.029
maybe we're not so different after all.

01:39:08.493 --> 01:39:10.245
Who are you under there?

01:39:16.334 --> 01:39:18.211
What are you hiding?

01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:22.424
Are you just...

01:39:24.009 --> 01:39:25.719
hideously scarred?

01:39:27.846 --> 01:39:28.847
Yeah.

01:39:36.104 --> 01:39:37.522
Listen to me.

01:39:39.065 --> 01:39:41.943
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

01:39:43.111 --> 01:39:47.782
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

01:39:48.408 --> 01:39:51.494
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

01:39:51.578 --> 01:39:52.829
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

01:39:52.913 --> 01:39:54.193
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

01:39:54.247 --> 01:39:56.291
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

01:39:56.374 --> 01:39:57.626
I think you'd be on his side.

01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:59.389
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

01:39:59.419 --> 01:40:01.379
What, do you live in a cave?

01:40:01.463 --> 01:40:03.548
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

01:40:04.633 --> 01:40:08.511
Listen, if I can find
that dick bag Kenzie,

01:40:08.595 --> 01:40:09.804
will you help me?

01:40:11.056 --> 01:40:12.349
Please.

01:40:15.143 --> 01:40:17.062
Come on, Vengeance.

01:40:19.522 --> 01:40:21.775
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

01:40:21.858 --> 01:40:23.618
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

01:40:33.036 --> 01:40:34.579
I told you, baby.

01:40:36.498 --> 01:40:39.084
I can take care of myself.

01:40:49.886 --> 01:40:53.181
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

01:41:01.022 --> 01:41:04.609
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

01:41:04.734 --> 01:41:06.570
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

01:41:06.778 --> 01:41:09.197
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

01:41:09.364 --> 01:41:10.824
<i>it's a passion.</i>

01:41:11.533 --> 01:41:13.869
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

01:41:15.078 --> 01:41:17.414
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

01:41:17.497 --> 01:41:19.958
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

01:41:20.041 --> 01:41:23.211
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

01:41:24.546 --> 01:41:29.217
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

01:41:29.301 --> 01:41:32.971
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:35.223
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

01:41:35.307 --> 01:41:37.809
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

01:41:37.893 --> 01:41:39.519
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

01:41:39.603 --> 01:41:45.191
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

01:41:45.275 --> 01:41:49.946
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:52.407
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

01:41:53.241 --> 01:41:55.743
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

01:41:55.826 --> 01:41:59.747
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

01:41:59.872 --> 01:42:01.916
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:06.712
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

01:42:06.795 --> 01:42:09.381
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

01:42:09.506 --> 01:42:12.551
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

01:42:13.135 --> 01:42:18.390
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

01:42:18.891 --> 01:42:21.268
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

01:42:21.352 --> 01:42:23.729
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

01:42:23.812 --> 01:42:27.274
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

01:42:27.358 --> 01:42:30.152
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

01:42:31.695 --> 01:42:33.531
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:40.371
Do you know who I am?

01:42:41.997 --> 01:42:43.123
You're Bruce Wayne.

01:42:43.207 --> 01:42:45.084
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

01:42:55.844 --> 01:42:56.845
See?

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:10.776
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

01:43:11.527 --> 01:43:13.654
Must have made a fortune.

01:43:14.113 --> 01:43:15.993
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

01:43:17.366 --> 01:43:19.827
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:20.911
No, boss.

01:43:20.995 --> 01:43:23.330
$1,183.

01:43:23.914 --> 01:43:25.875
You know why communism failed, right?

01:43:25.958 --> 01:43:26.959
No, boss.

01:43:28.878 --> 01:43:30.129
Austerity.

01:43:32.381 --> 01:43:34.008
All right. All right.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.677
Look at that. Perfect.

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.560
It's never gonna be that good again.

01:43:40.723 --> 01:43:43.225
Hey, Johnny Slick.

01:43:43.309 --> 01:43:44.476
What are you doing here?

01:43:46.395 --> 01:43:48.230
Give us a moment here, fellas.

01:43:49.148 --> 01:43:50.190
Come on.

01:43:52.109 --> 01:43:53.319
See ya, champ.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.571
Come on, sweetheart.

01:43:57.531 --> 01:43:58.532
Have a seat.

01:44:00.576 --> 01:44:02.369
I thought I might hear from you.

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:06.665
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:10.002
stirring things up, huh?

01:44:10.085 --> 01:44:11.795
- Is it true?
- What?

01:44:13.088 --> 01:44:14.715
That reporter business?

01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:17.319
What do you want to know here, kid?

01:44:17.343 --> 01:44:20.137
Did you kill him? For my father?

01:44:20.221 --> 01:44:22.973
Look, your father was in trouble.

01:44:23.849 --> 01:44:25.643
This reporter had some dirt.

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:27.353
Some very...

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.274
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

01:44:32.358 --> 01:44:35.069
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

01:44:35.152 --> 01:44:36.671
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

01:44:36.695 --> 01:44:38.614
not right before the election.

01:44:39.073 --> 01:44:41.367
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:43.077
but he wasn't going for it.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:46.330
So, he came to me.

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:48.791
Well, I never seen him like that.

01:44:49.625 --> 01:44:51.460
He said, "Carmine,

01:44:52.253 --> 01:44:56.966
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

01:44:59.385 --> 01:45:02.304
And when fear isn't enough...

01:45:02.972 --> 01:45:04.807
Oof. Hmm.

01:45:06.141 --> 01:45:09.478
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

01:45:10.479 --> 01:45:12.314
I handled it.

01:45:14.024 --> 01:45:15.442
I know.

01:45:15.526 --> 01:45:17.778
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

01:45:19.029 --> 01:45:20.865
But you'd be surprised

01:45:20.948 --> 01:45:23.325
what even a good man like him

01:45:23.409 --> 01:45:25.995
is capable of in the right situation.

01:45:28.247 --> 01:45:29.707
Do me a favor.

01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:32.084
Don't lose any sleep over it.

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.378
This reporter

01:45:35.212 --> 01:45:36.797
was a lowlife.

01:45:36.881 --> 01:45:38.340
He was on Maroni's payroll.

01:45:39.967 --> 01:45:41.594
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:42.344 --> 01:45:45.598
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

01:45:47.016 --> 01:45:50.519
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

01:45:50.603 --> 01:45:52.938
that your father would be in my pocket,

01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:54.690
forever.

01:45:55.357 --> 01:45:57.401
He would have done anything

01:45:57.484 --> 01:45:59.653
to keep him from becoming mayor.

01:45:59.737 --> 01:46:01.071
You understand?

01:46:02.281 --> 01:46:06.827
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

01:46:06.911 --> 01:46:08.954
Do I know it for a fact?

01:46:11.373 --> 01:46:13.459
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

01:46:14.835 --> 01:46:17.129
This is what you wanted, huh?

01:46:17.213 --> 01:46:19.632
This little conversation here?

01:46:22.051 --> 01:46:24.220
It's been a long time coming, huh?

01:46:26.847 --> 01:46:28.974
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

01:47:38.376 --> 01:47:39.669
You lied to me...

01:47:42.505 --> 01:47:44.132
my whole life.

01:47:49.304 --> 01:47:51.347
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

01:47:54.434 --> 01:47:57.729
He told me what he did for my father.

01:48:01.733 --> 01:48:03.234
About Salvatore Maroni.

01:48:05.236 --> 01:48:07.947
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

01:48:08.031 --> 01:48:09.782
Had my father killed.

01:48:12.243 --> 01:48:14.454
Why didn't you tell me all this?

01:48:17.207 --> 01:48:21.753
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

01:48:21.836 --> 01:48:24.172
believing that he was a good man.

01:48:24.255 --> 01:48:25.840
He was a good man.

01:48:27.008 --> 01:48:28.718
You listen to me.

01:48:28.801 --> 01:48:32.222
Your father was a good man.

01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:37.769
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

01:48:37.852 --> 01:48:39.771
He had a man killed.

01:48:39.854 --> 01:48:40.939
Why?

01:48:42.106 --> 01:48:45.360
To protect his family image?

01:48:46.444 --> 01:48:47.695
His political aspirations?

01:48:47.779 --> 01:48:51.324
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:55.453
He was protecting your mother.

01:48:56.412 --> 01:48:59.958
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

01:49:00.041 --> 01:49:02.168
He cared about her,

01:49:02.252 --> 01:49:03.545
and you,

01:49:03.628 --> 01:49:06.548
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

01:49:06.631 --> 01:49:10.093
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

01:49:10.969 --> 01:49:14.305
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

01:49:14.389 --> 01:49:17.517
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.435
That's who Falcone is.

01:49:21.688 --> 01:49:23.898
And that was your father's mistake.

01:49:23.982 --> 01:49:26.025
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:28.862
your father was distraught.

01:49:29.737 --> 01:49:32.949
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

01:49:33.032 --> 01:49:35.201
that he would confess everything.

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:38.705
And that night,

01:49:38.788 --> 01:49:42.709
your father and your mother were killed.

01:49:48.214 --> 01:49:49.966
It was Falcone?

01:49:56.014 --> 01:49:58.141
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

01:50:02.854 --> 01:50:06.399
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

01:50:06.482 --> 01:50:09.235
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

01:50:09.319 --> 01:50:14.532
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

01:50:16.284 --> 01:50:20.163
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:22.624
I know you always blamed yourself.

01:50:22.707 --> 01:50:25.251
You were only a boy, Bruce.

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.714
I could see the fear in your eyes,

01:50:31.132 --> 01:50:33.509
but I didn't know how to help.

01:50:33.593 --> 01:50:36.095
I could teach you how to fight,

01:50:37.472 --> 01:50:40.141
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

01:50:40.225 --> 01:50:42.060
You needed a father.

01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:46.439
And all you had was me.

01:50:48.816 --> 01:50:50.026
I'm sorry.

01:50:51.778 --> 01:50:53.696
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

01:51:00.495 --> 01:51:01.579
God.

01:51:04.624 --> 01:51:09.045
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

01:51:11.756 --> 01:51:13.883
I thought I'd mastered all that.

01:51:20.305 --> 01:51:21.557
I mean,

01:51:22.766 --> 01:51:24.893
I'm not afraid to die.

01:51:26.645 --> 01:51:29.022
I realize now there's something

01:51:30.148 --> 01:51:32.025
I haven't got past.

01:51:32.943 --> 01:51:34.695
This fear...

01:51:37.155 --> 01:51:40.117
of ever going through any of that again.

01:51:44.371 --> 01:51:46.582
Of losing somebody I care about.

01:52:37.174 --> 01:52:38.174
Hey.

01:52:38.217 --> 01:52:40.969
I saw the signal. That's not you?

01:52:41.053 --> 01:52:42.971
I thought it was you.

01:52:55.901 --> 01:52:57.444
- I found him!
- I see that.

01:52:57.528 --> 01:52:59.029
He had my shit and my phone.

01:52:59.112 --> 01:53:00.381
She left a message
the night they took her.

01:53:00.405 --> 01:53:01.323
She called me...

01:53:01.406 --> 01:53:03.116
Gordon! Help me out, man!

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.493
She got my gun!

01:53:05.827 --> 01:53:07.538
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

01:53:09.081 --> 01:53:11.625
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

01:53:16.213 --> 01:53:18.298
Here. Listen.

01:53:20.259 --> 01:53:21.927
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

01:53:22.052 --> 01:53:24.252
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

01:53:24.304 --> 01:53:26.390
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

01:53:26.473 --> 01:53:27.808
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

01:53:27.891 --> 01:53:29.601
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

01:53:29.685 --> 01:53:30.787
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

01:53:30.811 --> 01:53:32.104
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

01:53:32.187 --> 01:53:34.857
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

01:53:36.733 --> 01:53:38.777
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

01:53:39.486 --> 01:53:42.030
<i>- What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
<i>- No, nothing. He...</i>

01:53:42.114 --> 01:53:45.033
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

01:53:45.117 --> 01:53:47.828
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

01:53:48.370 --> 01:53:50.372
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:53.959
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

01:53:54.042 --> 01:53:56.753
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

01:53:56.837 --> 01:53:59.023
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

01:53:59.047 --> 01:54:02.175
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

01:54:03.010 --> 01:54:05.554
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

01:54:06.638 --> 01:54:07.973
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

01:54:08.765 --> 01:54:12.311
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

01:54:12.811 --> 01:54:14.021
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

01:54:14.104 --> 01:54:16.064
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

01:54:16.148 --> 01:54:17.441
<i>The deal.</i>

01:54:17.524 --> 01:54:22.446
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

01:54:22.529 --> 01:54:25.240
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

01:54:25.324 --> 01:54:27.701
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

01:54:27.784 --> 01:54:28.911
<i>Right.</i>

01:54:29.661 --> 01:54:31.038
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:54:31.997 --> 01:54:34.166
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.234
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

01:54:43.258 --> 01:54:44.801
Jesus, he's strangling her.

01:54:44.885 --> 01:54:47.930
<i>Take it easy.</i>

01:54:57.147 --> 01:54:58.440
<i>Rata A lad a.</i>

01:55:03.195 --> 01:55:04.988
A falcon has wings too.

01:55:05.322 --> 01:55:07.157
Falcone is the rat?

01:55:18.126 --> 01:55:21.296
Falcone works for you guys?

01:55:21.964 --> 01:55:24.508
The mayor? The DA?

01:55:27.511 --> 01:55:28.595
No.

01:55:31.682 --> 01:55:32.975
We work for him.

01:55:33.976 --> 01:55:35.227
Everybody does.

01:55:35.310 --> 01:55:36.311
How?

01:55:36.395 --> 01:55:37.980
Through Renewal.

01:55:38.772 --> 01:55:40.148
Renewal is everything.

01:55:40.232 --> 01:55:41.632
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

01:55:42.150 --> 01:55:45.863
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

01:55:45.946 --> 01:55:49.533
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

01:55:49.616 --> 01:55:52.995
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

01:55:53.078 --> 01:55:55.163
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

01:55:55.247 --> 01:55:56.956
Everybody got a piece.

01:55:57.039 --> 01:55:58.875
But Falcone wanted more.

01:56:00.668 --> 01:56:03.880
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

01:56:05.298 --> 01:56:07.633
He'd rat out his drops operation,

01:56:08.009 --> 01:56:10.720
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

01:56:10.803 --> 01:56:13.264
then install them all as his puppets.

01:56:13.347 --> 01:56:15.892
You think this goddamn election matters?

01:56:17.518 --> 01:56:19.437
Falcone's the mayor.

01:56:20.396 --> 01:56:22.899
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

01:56:22.982 --> 01:56:24.358
Come on, Vengeance.

01:56:25.067 --> 01:56:26.903
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

01:56:27.612 --> 01:56:29.298
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

01:56:29.322 --> 01:56:30.156
No!

01:56:31.616 --> 01:56:32.825
We'll get him.

01:56:33.492 --> 01:56:35.369
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

01:56:35.453 --> 01:56:36.579
He owns the city!

01:56:36.662 --> 01:56:37.914
Cross that line...

01:56:38.706 --> 01:56:39.999
you'll become just like him.

01:56:40.708 --> 01:56:42.251
Listen to me.

01:56:42.335 --> 01:56:44.212
Don't throw your life away.

01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:52.136
Don't worry, honey.

01:56:55.223 --> 01:56:56.682
I got nine of 'em.

01:56:56.807 --> 01:56:58.768
No, don't! Hey, hey!

01:57:00.061 --> 01:57:01.354
Oh, God!

01:57:10.655 --> 01:57:11.924
She won't get out of there alive.

01:57:11.948 --> 01:57:14.534
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

01:57:14.617 --> 01:57:15.618
I have to stop her.

01:57:15.785 --> 01:57:16.785
Don't you mean "we"?

01:57:18.079 --> 01:57:19.622
I gotta do this my way.

01:57:19.956 --> 01:57:20.957
And then what?

01:57:21.832 --> 01:57:23.209
We do what Riddler said.

01:57:24.043 --> 01:57:25.670
Bring the rat into the light.

01:58:01.622 --> 01:58:03.666
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

01:58:03.749 --> 01:58:05.209
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

01:58:05.835 --> 01:58:07.169
Tell him it's about Annika.

01:58:10.423 --> 01:58:11.757
Hey!

01:58:12.592 --> 01:58:14.010
Look who it is, huh?

01:58:14.093 --> 01:58:16.512
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

01:58:16.596 --> 01:58:18.598
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

01:58:18.764 --> 01:58:20.224
Absolutely.

01:58:21.976 --> 01:58:22.977
Alone?

01:58:39.535 --> 01:58:40.620
Hey!

01:58:51.172 --> 01:58:52.441
I'm just so worried.

01:58:52.465 --> 01:58:54.091
I don't know where she is.

01:58:55.843 --> 01:58:59.222
And I know
that you're a very important man.

01:58:59.305 --> 01:59:02.725
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

01:59:04.227 --> 01:59:06.604
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

01:59:08.064 --> 01:59:09.190
I'm sorry.

01:59:09.398 --> 01:59:10.483
It's okay.

01:59:10.566 --> 01:59:12.693
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.738
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

01:59:19.992 --> 01:59:20.910
Mr. Falcone?

01:59:20.993 --> 01:59:22.453
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

01:59:22.537 --> 01:59:25.456
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

01:59:27.833 --> 01:59:29.335
I'm sorry, beautiful.

01:59:29.418 --> 01:59:30.836
I'll be right back.

01:59:46.143 --> 01:59:47.228
Holy shit.

01:59:47.311 --> 01:59:49.039
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

01:59:49.063 --> 01:59:51.774

01:59:51.858 --> 01:59:54.694

01:59:57.613 --> 02:00:01.117
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

02:00:01.242 --> 02:00:02.785
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

02:00:02.952 --> 02:00:04.620
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

02:00:04.704 --> 02:00:06.205
<i>The deal.</i>

02:00:06.289 --> 02:00:11.085
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

02:00:11.168 --> 02:00:14.088
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

02:00:14.171 --> 02:00:16.716
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

02:00:16.799 --> 02:00:17.800
<i>Right.</i>

02:00:18.676 --> 02:00:19.886
<i>Hmm.</i>

02:00:19.969 --> 02:00:21.178

02:00:32.732 --> 02:00:33.983
Hey, Dad.

02:00:35.026 --> 02:00:36.026
What?

02:00:36.484 --> 02:00:38.528
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

02:00:40.155 --> 02:00:41.615
You remember her?

02:00:43.658 --> 02:00:44.701
Yeah.

02:00:48.997 --> 02:00:50.141
Just put down the gun, honey.

02:00:50.165 --> 02:00:51.249
This is for my mother.

02:01:48.515 --> 02:01:49.683
I see him!

02:02:33.727 --> 02:02:35.478
You don't think this hurts me?

02:02:40.066 --> 02:02:42.360
My own flesh and blood, huh?

02:02:58.752 --> 02:03:00.587
You made me do this.

02:03:02.005 --> 02:03:03.798
Just like your mother.

02:03:09.804 --> 02:03:11.139
He has to pay!

02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:16.300
You don't have to pay with him.

02:03:19.814 --> 02:03:21.316
You paid enough.

02:03:55.892 --> 02:03:57.018
Jesus.

02:03:57.102 --> 02:03:59.813
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

02:03:59.896 --> 02:04:02.983
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

02:04:03.066 --> 02:04:04.317
I'm gonna start crying,

02:04:04.401 --> 02:04:06.903
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

02:04:06.987 --> 02:04:08.613
Let me tell you something.

02:04:08.697 --> 02:04:10.407
Whatever I know,

02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:12.367
whatever I've done,

02:04:12.450 --> 02:04:16.788
it's all going with me to my grave.

02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:29.301
What, are you with Zorro over here?

02:04:30.927 --> 02:04:33.221
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

02:04:41.146 --> 02:04:43.481
I guess we don't all work for you.

02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:54.034
You have the right to remain silent.

02:04:54.868 --> 02:04:58.371
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

02:04:58.455 --> 02:04:59.815
You have the right to an attorney.

02:04:59.873 --> 02:05:01.041
If you cannot afford one,

02:05:01.124 --> 02:05:02.918
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

02:05:03.001 --> 02:05:04.711
Do you understand these rights?

02:05:06.213 --> 02:05:07.797
Do you understand?

02:05:09.758 --> 02:05:10.842
Yeah.

02:05:10.926 --> 02:05:13.011
I'll see you when I walk out.

02:05:13.094 --> 02:05:14.155
With these rights in mind,

02:05:14.179 --> 02:05:15.531
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

02:05:15.555 --> 02:05:16.805
Goddamn rat.

02:05:18.766 --> 02:05:20.100
What'd you say?

02:05:20.184 --> 02:05:21.936
Enjoy your night at Black gate, Carmine.

02:05:23.062 --> 02:05:24.313
Probably be your last.

02:05:24.563 --> 02:05:27.608
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

02:05:27.691 --> 02:05:28.776
Maybe I am.

02:05:28.859 --> 02:05:30.069
Really, Oz?

02:05:30.152 --> 02:05:34.865
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

02:05:34.949 --> 02:05:36.033
I'll spray paint your ass!

02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:41.440
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

02:05:41.664 --> 02:05:43.666
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.460
Get your hands off of me!

02:06:06.021 --> 02:06:08.023
"Bring him into the light.

02:06:11.610 --> 02:06:13.571
And you'll find where I'm at."

02:06:13.654 --> 02:06:14.738
There!

02:06:14.822 --> 02:06:16.657
The shots came from up there!

02:06:18.242 --> 02:06:19.243
It's Riddler.

02:06:21.328 --> 02:06:22.496
Gage, on me.

02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:25.291
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

02:07:39.490 --> 02:07:40.699
He's gone.

02:07:50.501 --> 02:07:52.461
He's been here this whole time.

02:07:52.545 --> 02:07:54.880
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

02:07:54.964 --> 02:07:56.149
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

02:07:56.173 --> 02:07:58.902
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

02:07:58.926 --> 02:08:01.387
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:04.390
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

02:08:19.905 --> 02:08:21.991
Police! Hands up!

02:08:25.035 --> 02:08:28.539
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

02:08:47.683 --> 02:08:49.602
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

02:08:52.563 --> 02:08:53.856
Stay still!

02:08:53.939 --> 02:08:54.940
Now!

02:09:23.594 --> 02:09:25.387
Which one is you?

02:09:25.471 --> 02:09:26.972
You tell me.

02:09:27.806 --> 02:09:29.266
Let's go, pencil-neck.

02:09:32.353 --> 02:09:34.104
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

02:09:48.619 --> 02:09:51.539
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

02:09:51.622 --> 02:09:54.208

<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live

02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:58.002
Hey.

02:10:22.443 --> 02:10:24.153
What are all these diaries?

02:10:24.237 --> 02:10:26.656
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

02:10:26.739 --> 02:10:30.285
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

02:10:30.368 --> 02:10:31.911
Got something back on one of the IDs.

02:10:31.995 --> 02:10:34.289
Edward Nash ton. Works at KTMJ.

02:10:34.372 --> 02:10:36.207
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

02:10:36.291 --> 02:10:38.710
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

02:10:38.793 --> 02:10:40.545
What about chain of evidence?

02:10:41.379 --> 02:10:42.589
You should see this.

02:10:48.553 --> 02:10:50.054
He's wearing gloves.

02:10:51.514 --> 02:10:53.766
"Friday, July 16th.

02:10:53.850 --> 02:10:57.562
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

02:10:57.896 --> 02:11:00.940
suffocating my mind, no escape.

02:11:01.024 --> 02:11:02.442
But then, today, I saw it.

02:11:02.525 --> 02:11:06.654
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

02:11:07.989 --> 02:11:09.782
'Renewal.'

02:11:09.866 --> 02:11:14.287
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

02:11:14.370 --> 02:11:17.498
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

02:11:17.582 --> 02:11:20.919
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

02:11:21.002 --> 02:11:23.463
The moment when I would learn the truth.

02:11:23.546 --> 02:11:26.549
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

02:11:27.675 --> 02:11:29.570
"If you want people to understand,

02:11:29.594 --> 02:11:31.429
really understand,

02:11:31.512 --> 02:11:33.806
you can't just give them the answers.

02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:35.350
You have to confront them,

02:11:35.433 --> 02:11:37.852
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

02:11:37.936 --> 02:11:40.104
just like they tortured me.

02:11:40.188 --> 02:11:42.982
I know now what I must become."

02:11:45.944 --> 02:11:47.278
Jesus.

02:11:53.368 --> 02:11:55.328
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:57.372
This one's not a rat.

02:12:14.013 --> 02:12:15.139
What is that?

02:12:46.754 --> 02:12:48.023
Some kind of pry tool?

02:12:48.047 --> 02:12:49.424
Is it a chisel?

02:12:49.507 --> 02:12:50.967
It's a murder weapon.

02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:52.427
He killed Mitchell with it.

02:12:53.094 --> 02:12:55.972
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

02:13:04.564 --> 02:13:06.566
"My confession"?

02:13:06.649 --> 02:13:09.527
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

02:13:09.611 --> 02:13:10.987
This isn't over.

02:13:11.070 --> 02:13:13.590
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

02:13:13.907 --> 02:13:16.117
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

02:13:24.209 --> 02:13:26.419
His final post was last night.

02:13:26.502 --> 02:13:29.714
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

02:13:29.797 --> 02:13:32.800
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

02:13:32.926 --> 02:13:36.346
Take some time, but we'll get in.

02:13:47.690 --> 02:13:50.235
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

02:13:51.861 --> 02:13:53.571
"The Truth Unmasked."

02:13:54.405 --> 02:13:56.032
I think I'm his last target.

02:13:58.618 --> 02:13:59.702
You?

02:14:00.078 --> 02:14:02.121
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

02:14:02.664 --> 02:14:04.040
What is?

02:14:04.499 --> 02:14:05.917
The Batman.

02:14:11.297 --> 02:14:12.465
Yeah?

02:14:23.768 --> 02:14:24.978
Right.

02:14:27.856 --> 02:14:31.818
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

02:14:39.283 --> 02:14:40.784
You're a good cop.

<i>What do you want from me?</i>

02:15:10.439 --> 02:15:11.982
"Want"?

02:15:12.566 --> 02:15:16.195
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

02:15:17.404 --> 02:15:18.739
<i>For this moment.</i>

02:15:19.781 --> 02:15:22.784
I've been invisible my whole life.

02:15:23.869 --> 02:15:26.496
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:30.459
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

02:15:30.542 --> 02:15:32.377
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

<i>Bruce...</i>

02:15:47.601 --> 02:15:49.436
<i>Wayne.</i>

02:15:51.813 --> 02:15:55.567

<i>Wayne.</i>

02:16:11.124 --> 02:16:13.544

<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

02:16:19.591 --> 02:16:21.969
<i>made all those promises.</i>

02:16:24.429 --> 02:16:28.684
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

02:16:29.226 --> 02:16:32.771
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

02:16:32.855 --> 02:16:36.525
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

02:16:37.109 --> 02:16:38.652
<i>Orphan.</i>

02:16:44.324 --> 02:16:49.454
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

02:16:50.747 --> 02:16:55.377
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

02:16:56.044 --> 02:16:57.588
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

02:17:00.215 --> 02:17:02.885
Do you know what being an orphan is?

02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:05.846
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

02:17:07.139 --> 02:17:11.185
<i>Twelve years old and already a drop head,
numbing the pain.</i>

02:17:12.895 --> 02:17:17.566
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

02:17:18.734 --> 02:17:21.904
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

02:17:21.987 --> 02:17:24.281
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

02:17:25.574 --> 02:17:28.160
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

02:17:31.079 --> 02:17:34.249
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

02:17:34.333 --> 02:17:37.252
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

02:17:37.336 --> 02:17:38.337
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

02:17:39.796 --> 02:17:41.840
<i>Bruce...</i>

02:17:42.883 --> 02:17:44.801
<i>Wayne.</i>

<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

02:17:59.566 --> 02:18:03.445
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

02:18:06.615 --> 02:18:07.783
<i>God.</i>

02:18:08.784 --> 02:18:10.077
<i>Look at you.</i>

02:18:11.745 --> 02:18:14.206
Your mask is amazing.

02:18:14.289 --> 02:18:17.209
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

02:18:17.292 --> 02:18:18.377
Ain't it funny?

02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:22.881
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

02:18:24.341 --> 02:18:26.385
<i>You and I both know</i>

02:18:27.344 --> 02:18:29.846
I'm looking at the real you right now.

02:18:29.930 --> 02:18:33.559
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

02:18:33.642 --> 02:18:35.185
<i>No shame,</i>

02:18:36.103 --> 02:18:37.104
<i>no limits.</i>

02:18:37.187 --> 02:18:38.856
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

02:18:39.731 --> 02:18:40.732
<i>What do you mean?</i>

02:18:40.816 --> 02:18:42.526
<i>All those cards.</i>

02:18:42.609 --> 02:18:43.819
<i>I told you,</i>

02:18:44.528 --> 02:18:46.506
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

02:18:46.530 --> 02:18:48.740
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

02:18:48.824 --> 02:18:50.284
<i>What did we just do?</i>

02:18:50.367 --> 02:18:52.428
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

02:18:52.452 --> 02:18:53.620
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

02:18:53.704 --> 02:18:54.705
<i>We're not a team.</i>

02:18:54.788 --> 02:18:57.291
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

02:18:57.374 --> 02:18:59.793
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

02:18:59.877 --> 02:19:03.046
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:04.770
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:06.049
You gave me that.

02:19:06.133 --> 02:19:07.259
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

02:19:07.342 --> 02:19:09.928
You showed me what was possible.

02:19:10.012 --> 02:19:14.892
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

02:19:14.975 --> 02:19:16.518
<i>You inspired me.</i>

02:19:16.602 --> 02:19:18.102
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

02:19:19.228 --> 02:19:20.313
<i>What?</i>

02:19:20.396 --> 02:19:22.565
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

02:19:22.648 --> 02:19:24.025
<i>How can you say that?</i>

02:19:24.108 --> 02:19:25.610
You think you'll be remembered?

02:19:25.693 --> 02:19:27.361
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

02:19:27.862 --> 02:19:29.614
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

02:19:29.697 --> 02:19:31.365
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

02:19:31.449 --> 02:19:32.491
<i>No, no!</i>

02:19:32.575 --> 02:19:33.575
<i>A nobody!</i>

02:19:35.286 --> 02:19:37.079
<i>No!</i>

02:19:38.998 --> 02:19:41.375
<i>Ahhh!</i>

02:19:41.626 --> 02:19:44.212
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

02:19:45.171 --> 02:19:48.799
<i>Ahhh!</i>

02:19:48.883 --> 02:19:51.510
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

02:19:52.511 --> 02:19:54.513
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

02:19:54.889 --> 02:19:58.184
We could watch the whole thing together.

02:19:58.267 --> 02:19:59.268
<i>Watch what?</i>

02:19:59.352 --> 02:20:01.103
<i>Everything!</i>

02:20:09.445 --> 02:20:11.113
<i>It was all there.</i>

02:20:13.282 --> 02:20:15.618
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

02:20:19.914 --> 02:20:23.834
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

02:20:25.878 --> 02:20:27.964
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

02:20:28.422 --> 02:20:29.674
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:30.383 --> 02:20:35.263
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

02:20:38.099 --> 02:20:39.934
<i>You.</i>

02:20:41.602 --> 02:20:43.729
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

02:20:45.064 --> 02:20:46.607
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:53.990
<i>Ave Maria</i>

02:20:54.407 --> 02:20:56.284
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:58.744 --> 02:21:00.121
<i>Gratia plena</i>

02:21:00.288 --> 02:21:01.706
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:21:05.710 --> 02:21:09.088
<i>Maria</i>

02:21:09.255 --> 02:21:14.802
<i>Gratia plena</i>

What are you doing in here?

02:22:08.272 --> 02:22:10.858
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

02:22:17.448 --> 02:22:19.909
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

02:22:20.785 --> 02:22:23.538
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

02:22:28.209 --> 02:22:31.254
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

02:22:31.337 --> 02:22:33.506
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

02:22:33.589 --> 02:22:35.841
It's a tucker.

02:22:53.651 --> 02:22:54.652
Huh.

02:23:09.834 --> 02:23:12.628
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

02:23:12.712 --> 02:23:14.213
What are you doing?

02:23:44.744 --> 02:23:46.162
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

02:23:46.495 --> 02:23:48.706
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

02:23:48.789 --> 02:23:51.751
<i>and a special thanks to everyone

02:23:51.834 --> 02:23:52.835
Detonators?

02:23:52.919 --> 02:23:57.964

02:24:13.271 --> 02:24:14.356
Jesus.

<i>Tomorrow's Election Day.</i>

<i>She promised real change.</i>

<i>But we know the truth, don't we?</i>

02:24:32.499 --> 02:24:34.584
<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

02:24:34.668 --> 02:24:36.545
<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

02:24:36.628 --> 02:24:39.589
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

02:24:39.673 --> 02:24:43.510

02:24:43.593 --> 02:24:47.430

02:24:49.641 --> 02:24:53.645
<i>The day of judgment is finally upon us.</i>

02:24:53.728 --> 02:24:56.106
<i>And now it is time</i>

02:24:59.651 --> 02:25:02.445

02:25:06.283 --> 02:25:08.159
<i>And on the big night,</i>

Boom!

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

<i>Those who are not washed away</i>

Call Gordon.

02:25:50.994 --> 02:25:53.121
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

<i>...celebrations will turn to panic,</i>

02:26:01.504 --> 02:26:06.343

02:26:07.719 --> 02:26:11.723
<i>And that's where all of you come in.</i>

02:26:18.146 --> 02:26:21.441
<i>Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.</i>

02:26:21.525 --> 02:26:23.693

<i>We'll give them real, real change now.</i>

02:26:58.019 --> 02:27:03.024
<i>We've spent our lives in this
wretched place,</i> <i>suffering!</i>

02:27:03.483 --> 02:27:05.986
<i>Wondering, "Why us?"</i>

02:27:06.069 --> 02:27:09.197
<i>Now they will spend

02:27:09.281 --> 02:27:11.449
<i>why them?</i>

02:27:11.533 --> 02:27:13.577
I can't get through! The lines are down.

02:27:19.207 --> 02:27:21.376
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:23.587
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:26.548
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

02:27:26.631 --> 02:27:28.651
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

02:27:38.226 --> 02:27:39.954
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

02:27:39.978 --> 02:27:41.539
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

02:27:41.563 --> 02:27:43.398
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

02:27:43.481 --> 02:27:44.733
We got an active situation.

02:27:44.858 --> 02:27:46.210
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

02:27:46.234 --> 02:27:47.503
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

02:27:47.527 --> 02:27:48.445
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

02:27:48.528 --> 02:27:49.362
Come!

02:28:25.398 --> 02:28:26.876
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:27.776
...we're gonna have huge problems.

02:28:27.859 --> 02:28:29.295
The water's already started to breach.

02:28:29.319 --> 02:28:30.922
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

02:28:30.946 --> 02:28:33.216
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:35.134
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

02:28:35.158 --> 02:28:37.552
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

02:28:37.576 --> 02:28:39.888
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

02:28:39.912 --> 02:28:42.164
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

02:28:42.248 --> 02:28:44.083
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

02:28:44.166 --> 02:28:47.169
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

02:28:47.253 --> 02:28:48.754
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

02:28:53.926 --> 02:28:57.388
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

02:28:57.471 --> 02:28:59.765
Please! I just need your attention!

02:29:15.656 --> 02:29:16.782
You're okay!

02:30:47.706 --> 02:30:50.334
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

02:30:50.417 --> 02:30:51.627
Follow me, sir.

02:33:01.632 --> 02:33:03.133
No, no. It's okay.

02:33:03.217 --> 02:33:04.260
It's okay.

02:33:05.427 --> 02:33:06.470
It's okay.

02:33:08.097 --> 02:33:10.224
It's done now. It's done.

02:33:12.935 --> 02:33:14.270
It's over.

02:34:10.116 --> 02:34:13.578
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

02:34:14.287 --> 02:34:16.623
Take it easy. Easy.

02:34:45.193 --> 02:34:46.319
Jesus.

02:34:56.162 --> 02:34:57.830
Who the hell are you?

02:35:02.043 --> 02:35:03.044
Me?

02:35:06.214 --> 02:35:07.632
I'm Vengeance.

<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

02:38:56.777 --> 02:38:58.403
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

02:39:01.615 --> 02:39:05.327
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

<i>in the parts of the city

02:39:09.122 --> 02:39:12.834
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

02:39:15.796 --> 02:39:18.924
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:21.677
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

02:39:22.302 --> 02:39:23.762
But not just our city.

02:39:24.471 --> 02:39:28.684
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

02:39:28.767 --> 02:39:30.853
in our elected officials,

02:39:30.936 --> 02:39:32.229
in each other.

02:39:33.021 --> 02:39:36.358
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

02:39:40.696 --> 02:39:42.364
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

02:39:43.824 --> 02:39:45.993

02:39:48.078 --> 02:39:49.997

<i>I have to become more.</i>

02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:08.307
<i>People need hope.</i>

02:40:09.516 --> 02:40:11.727
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

02:40:15.522 --> 02:40:17.191
<i>The city's angry,</i>

02:40:18.108 --> 02:40:19.484

<i>like me.</i>

02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:25.866
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

02:40:27.242 --> 02:40:29.953
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

02:40:31.580 --> 02:40:33.332
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

02:40:34.833 --> 02:40:36.710
<i>they can transform us.</i>

02:40:38.587 --> 02:40:40.505
<i>They can give us the power</i>

02:40:41.465 --> 02:40:42.966
<i>to endure...</i>

02:40:44.343 --> 02:40:46.470
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

02:40:49.389 --> 02:40:51.558
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

02:40:51.642 --> 02:40:54.436
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:56.104
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

02:40:56.188 --> 02:40:57.874
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

02:40:57.898 --> 02:41:00.901
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

02:41:00.984 --> 02:41:03.529
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

02:41:03.612 --> 02:41:06.007
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

02:41:06.031 --> 02:41:08.492
Isn't that just terrible?

02:41:09.868 --> 02:41:11.787
Him...

02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:14.748
raining on your parade like that?

02:41:20.462 --> 02:41:22.464
What is it they say?

02:41:23.632 --> 02:41:25.801
"One day you're on top,

02:41:27.344 --> 02:41:29.012
the next...

02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:32.307
you're a clown."

02:41:34.685 --> 02:41:35.853
Well,

02:41:37.646 --> 02:41:40.482
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

02:41:42.776 --> 02:41:45.445
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

02:41:46.738 --> 02:41:48.574
You did so well.

02:41:53.078 --> 02:41:54.079
And you know,

02:41:55.747 --> 02:41:58.959
Gotham loves a comeback story.

02:42:09.011 --> 02:42:10.387
Who are you?

02:42:10.929 --> 02:42:13.348
Well, that's the question,

02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:15.767
isn't it?

02:42:18.687 --> 02:42:21.064
Riddle me this...

02:42:23.525 --> 02:42:25.652
"The less of them you have,

02:42:26.403 --> 02:42:30.240
the more one is worth."

02:42:35.662 --> 02:42:37.414
A friend.

02:43:03.648 --> 02:43:05.048
You're leaving.

02:43:05.566 --> 02:43:06.651
Jesus.

02:43:08.402 --> 02:43:09.987
Don't you ever just say hello?

02:43:15.076 --> 02:43:16.494
Where will you go?

02:43:17.995 --> 02:43:20.414
I don't know. Upstate.

02:43:20.831 --> 02:43:22.542
Bludhaven, maybe.

02:43:23.417 --> 02:43:24.418
Why?

02:43:25.628 --> 02:43:26.837
You asking me to stay?

02:43:33.886 --> 02:43:36.013
You know this place
is never gonna change.

02:43:36.430 --> 02:43:38.766
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

02:43:38.850 --> 02:43:40.768
There's gonna be a power grab.

02:43:42.395 --> 02:43:43.521
It'll be bloody.

02:43:44.146 --> 02:43:45.356
I know.

02:43:46.899 --> 02:43:47.984
But the city can change.

02:43:48.067 --> 02:43:49.318
It won't.

02:43:50.444 --> 02:43:51.445
I have to try.

02:43:51.529 --> 02:43:53.329
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

02:43:55.616 --> 02:43:56.742
Listen.

02:43:59.161 --> 02:44:00.413
Why don't you come with me?

02:44:01.372 --> 02:44:02.874
Get into some trouble.

02:44:03.624 --> 02:44:07.128
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

02:44:07.795 --> 02:44:09.422
The bat and the cat.

02:44:10.923 --> 02:44:12.592
It's got a nice ring.

02:44:25.938 --> 02:44:27.356
Who am I kidding?

02:44:28.816 --> 02:44:30.943
You're already spoken for.

02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:44.248
You should go.

02:44:52.590 --> 02:44:53.591
Selina...

02:44:57.678 --> 02:44:59.347
Take care of yourself.
