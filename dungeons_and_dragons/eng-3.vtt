WEBVTT

00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:04.629
It's them!

00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.155
Get ready.

00:01:08.981 --> 00:01:11.071
Two more prisoners coming in!

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:14.204
Prepare for docking!

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.859
In position!

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:20.210
Easy!

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:30.742
Gate secure!

00:01:49.283 --> 00:01:51.154
Prisoner walking!

00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:19.965
Oh, great.
Another cellmate.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.533
No offense, pal.
You seem lovely.

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.668
Uh... Let's show you around.
Get you situated here.

00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:31.238
This is the bucket where
our pee freezes. And, um...

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:33.064
Yeah, that's it.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.850
What's your name, lass?

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:37.679
Uh, That's Holga.
I'm Edgin. And you are?

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:42.640
I've been in a lot of cells.
Never shared one with a female.

00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:44.120
Think I'm gonna like it.

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:46.296
Word of advice,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.970
Holga doesn't love to be disturbed
while she's eating her potatoes.

00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:51.519
Kind of the highlight
of her day. Shut up, you!

00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:53.651
Sure thing. Have at it.

00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:56.350
Little shy, eh?

00:02:56.524 --> 00:02:59.701
I'm not so bad once
you get to know me.

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:01.137
Mmm.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.574
Don't be like that.

00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:07.012
We could be very happy to...

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:16.370
I think I'm gonna do this without
fingers and make it a mitten.

00:03:17.153 --> 00:03:18.807
Who am I trying to impress?

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:33.735
Oi! Stop that singing!

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:35.911
You got it, Tobias.

00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.436
The Absolution Council
is tomorrow.

00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:41.786
Don't get your hopes up, Ed.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.614
What are you talking about?

00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:46.661
Jarnathan is on the council
this time. He's an Aarakocra.

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:48.750
If anyone's gonna free us,
it's him.

00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:50.404
Not gonna happen.

00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:54.364
I tell you, Holga, this is
your last day chopping ice.

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.762
By authority
of the Lords' Alliance,

00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:04.505
this Absolution Council
will now come to order

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:09.684
in the case of Edgin Darvis
and Holga Kilgore.

00:04:10.946 --> 00:04:14.254
This is the second year of
incarceration for the crimes

00:04:14.428 --> 00:04:17.866
of grand larceny
and skullduggery.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.175
It is the task of this council to
determine your eligibility for pardon.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.047
What say you?

00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:28.529
Thank you, Chancellor Anderton,
esteemed members of the council.

00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:34.404
Before I begin, I notice that
Chancellor Jarnathan is not present.

00:04:34.578 --> 00:04:36.188
Should we perhaps wait?

00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:39.627
Chancellor Jarnathan was delayed
by the storm. You may begin.

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:41.368
I see. It's just that I...

00:04:41.542 --> 00:04:44.849
We were really counting
on him to attend.

00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:47.199
Begin or waive your statement.

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:48.853
Very well.

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.510
I should start
by giving you some context.

00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:57.079
You may be surprised to learn
I wasn't always a thief.

00:04:57.253 --> 00:05:01.126
Years ago, I became a member
of the Harpers faction,

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.129
a network of spies who
swear an oath to fight tyranny,

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.655
defend the oppressed
and to ask nothing in return.

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:11.659
My wife, Zia, supported my decision,
even though she knew the risks.

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:16.533
By day,
I'd eavesdrop on mercenaries,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.058
stop bandits in their tracks...

00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:25.803
and even bring
Thayan Red Wizards to justice.

00:05:29.372 --> 00:05:33.333
By night, I'd come home to my
loving wife, and daughter, Kira.

00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:36.988
To be honest, there were times
when I began to question

00:05:37.162 --> 00:05:40.601
the 'asking nothing in return'
part of my oath.

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:42.733
But my wife would always say,

00:05:42.907 --> 00:05:45.649
'You don't have to give us everything,
you only have to give us you.'

00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:47.061
So what's the latest
on Jarnathan?

00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:49.000
Is he close by?
Because I can wait.

00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:51.263
Did you not hear what we said?
Right, the storm.

00:05:51.438 --> 00:05:53.614
It's just that based on
what I know about Jarnathan,

00:05:53.788 --> 00:05:55.790
I think he'd be especially
receptive to my story.

00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:57.966
And I'd hate to have to wait
a whole other year

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.229
to come back in here
and... Proceed.

00:06:00.403 --> 00:06:02.013
Absolutely. Here we go.

00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:04.581
When you're a Harper,
you're bound to make enemies.

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:09.064
And sometimes those enemies
come looking for revenge.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.900
No cleric can repair the damage
from a Red Wizard's blade.

00:07:03.074 --> 00:07:04.946
There was no way to revive her.

00:07:06.034 --> 00:07:10.038
When Zia died,
so did my devotion to my oath.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:32.147
I'm sorry, it's just hard
to relive this...

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:36.194
- without Jarnathan here.
- Again with this?

00:07:36.368 --> 00:07:38.521
But he missed the most
important part of my back story!

00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:40.677
How can he judge me
without knowing my motivation?

00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:44.376
We are entirely capable of deciding
your case without Jarnathan.

00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:47.205
- Get on with it!
- Fine. Where was I? Uh...

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:50.731
By night, I'd come home to my
loving wife, and daughter Kira.

00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:52.559
You went back too far.
Stop stalling!

00:07:52.733 --> 00:07:55.213
Right, sorry.
Yeah, broad strokes.

00:07:55.387 --> 00:08:00.218
The next few months
were among my most shameful.

00:08:02.917 --> 00:08:04.309
That's when I met Holga.

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:06.224
She took pity on me.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.967
Well, she took pity on the baby.

00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:12.709
Holga was a fellow resident
of rock bottom.

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:16.583
Many years before, she'd
been cast out of her tribe

00:08:16.757 --> 00:08:18.410
for falling in love
with an outsider.

00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:25.461
We quickly became like
brother and sister.

00:08:25.635 --> 00:08:29.073
With a relationship built
on trust and mutual respect.

00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:35.079
Neither of us had money
or an honest way to earn it,

00:08:35.253 --> 00:08:39.127
so we decided to table 'honest'
and we tried something new.

00:08:40.258 --> 00:08:42.522
It's intoxicating
when you realize

00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:46.134
that what separates you
from what you've always wanted

00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:49.224
can be as thin
as a pane of glass.

00:09:03.499 --> 00:09:06.284
You may be wondering how we could
carry on this criminal lifestyle

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:07.721
with a young girl at home.

00:09:08.809 --> 00:09:10.593
Well, we didn't
leave her at home.

00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:13.857
Hurry, hurry!
Run, run, run!

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:16.599
Kira wasn't
the only new recruit.

00:09:16.773 --> 00:09:19.341
We also added Simon,
a so-so sorcerer,

00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:23.563
and a con man named Forge, who
pushed us to aim even higher.

00:09:27.784 --> 00:09:30.004
Before long, we became a team.

00:09:31.222 --> 00:09:32.659
Yes, we were thieves,

00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:35.183
but I tried to hold us
to a certain standard.

00:09:35.357 --> 00:09:36.924
We never harmed anyone.

00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:40.057
And we only robbed from those
who would feel it the least.

00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:45.802
But everything changed
when we met the wizard Sofina.

00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:48.631
We knew almost nothing
about her.

00:09:48.805 --> 00:09:51.895
Only that she wanted our help
in robbing Korinn's Keep.

00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:54.724
That's a Harper stronghold.
I don't know if you've heard of it.

00:09:54.898 --> 00:09:57.031
I'm sure Jarnathan has.

00:09:57.205 --> 00:10:00.251
The keep was filled with the priceless
relics seized from evildoers,

00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:02.993
and only Harpers could
gain access to the vault.

00:10:03.167 --> 00:10:05.300
Which is why Sofina came to us.

00:10:05.474 --> 00:10:08.651
At first, I refused.
I wouldn't stoop that low.

00:10:08.825 --> 00:10:11.611
But then Forge told me that among
the relics in Korinn's Keep,

00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:13.917
there was
a Tablet of Reawakening,

00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:17.312
capable of bringing back
a single deceased person.

00:10:17.486 --> 00:10:20.054
Even one killed
by a Red Wizard's blade.

00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:22.360
You can probably see
where this is going.

00:10:22.534 --> 00:10:25.886
Why can't I come? Sorry, Kir,
this one's too dangerous.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.844
Then you shouldn't go.

00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:30.325
We have everything that we need.

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:33.415
Not yet.
But this is the last one.

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:35.635
Trust me.

00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:42.467
Chin up, Bug.
We'll be right back.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.322
I didn't tell her
about the tablet.

00:10:44.426 --> 00:10:46.186
It would break her heart
if it all went to shit.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.821
And, well,

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.953
to shit it went.

00:11:20.723 --> 00:11:21.724
See you soon, love.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.129
Intruders!

00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:36.825
There they are!

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.964
We don't hurt anyone.

00:12:00.154 --> 00:12:02.678
She's caught in the Time Stop!
Counter it, Simon!

00:12:02.852 --> 00:12:04.680
I can't.
Sofina's too powerful.

00:12:15.082 --> 00:12:17.737
Take the tablet.
Keep Kira safe.

00:12:22.306 --> 00:12:23.873
You have my word.

00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:38.061
The truth is, even if this council were
to sentence me to another two years,

00:12:38.235 --> 00:12:40.716
or 20 for that matter,

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.721
it would never be punishment enough
for the worst crime I ever committed...

00:12:47.549 --> 00:12:49.899
robbing my daughter
of her father.

00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:53.685
But know that,
if you do choose to free me,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.950
I'll spend the rest of my days
trying to right that wrong.

00:12:58.299 --> 00:12:59.953
Anything you want to add?

00:13:00.127 --> 00:13:01.432
I'm good.

00:13:07.395 --> 00:13:08.788
Before you announce
your decision,

00:13:08.962 --> 00:13:11.834
I implore you
to please wait for...

00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:15.664
Jarnathan! Pardon my belatedness.

00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:18.362
I can't tell you how happy
I am to see you! Step away!

00:13:18.536 --> 00:13:21.104
Holga, now! Guards!

00:13:21.278 --> 00:13:23.106
Release me, sir!

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.282
She's throwing potatoes!

00:13:26.109 --> 00:13:27.328
Oh, Jarnathan!

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.853
But we approved your pardon!

00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:46.738
Fly, bird, fly!

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:11.807
He's still breathing.

00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:16.464
I told you he'd get us out!

00:15:23.052 --> 00:15:24.053
Any sign of Kira?

00:15:25.794 --> 00:15:27.491
Been empty for a while.

00:15:43.507 --> 00:15:45.422
Where do you think
Forge took her?

00:15:45.596 --> 00:15:48.773
I can't see him leaving the Sword Coast.
Forge always liked cities.

00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:52.299
Some supper
for you and your wife?

00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:54.866
What? No.
She's not my wife. Me with that?

00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:57.869
With those lips? That's so gross.
Just the drinks.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.049
So, we take a boat
down to Baldur's Gate

00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:05.094
and then head north.

00:16:05.268 --> 00:16:08.706
And while we're looking for
Forge, I'll pay Marlamin a visit.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.350
You sure you really want
to put yourself through that?

00:16:12.493 --> 00:16:15.887
What if he doesn't want to talk to you?
It's not about what he wants.

00:16:16.062 --> 00:16:17.802
Okay. It's about closure.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.327
He sent you a letter saying
he wasn't your husband anymore.

00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:22.503
Wasn't that closure?

00:16:22.677 --> 00:16:24.244
You wouldn't understand. I don't.

00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:26.376
I clearly, clearly don't.

00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:32.904
Is that...

00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:35.820
Son of a bitch.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.910
Forge is Lord of Never winter.

00:16:39.085 --> 00:16:41.870
How did that clown
pull that off?

00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:44.133
Well, as long as he's got Kira,
I don't care.

00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:46.092
Come on. Let's go.

00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:49.225
Thanks, pal.
What's wrong with my lips?

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:51.532
They're too big
for your face. What?

00:16:51.706 --> 00:16:52.866
A lot of people like my lips.

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:25.348
I've never seen
this place so crowded.

00:17:25.522 --> 00:17:28.177
Must be coming in
for the High Sun Games.

00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:31.441
Yeah, my dad took me to the
last one before they were outlawed.

00:17:31.615 --> 00:17:33.095
Anyone win?

00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:35.445
Well, one contestant made it
to the final round

00:17:35.619 --> 00:17:38.144
before a monster ate
his upper body, so...

00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:40.407
no.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.717
It's nice to see that Forge
hasn't lost his sense of modesty.

00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:54.812
How long has it been? Two years.

00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:56.945
No, how long have
we been waiting here?

00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:00.427
Dad.

00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:02.603
Holga?

00:18:03.212 --> 00:18:04.213
Kira.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.479
Oh!

00:18:09.653 --> 00:18:12.308
- I missed you so much.
- Hello, Bug.

00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:16.747
- Come here.
- Hi.

00:18:17.313 --> 00:18:18.314
Oh.

00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:22.013
I thought about you every day.

00:18:26.844 --> 00:18:27.845
I made you these.

00:18:31.545 --> 00:18:33.460
- What are they?
- Mittens!

00:18:33.634 --> 00:18:36.550
Oh. Thanks.

00:18:37.681 --> 00:18:38.900
Have you been okay?

00:18:40.031 --> 00:18:42.295
Uncle Forge has been
very good to me.

00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:44.340
'Uncle' Forge?

00:18:46.342 --> 00:18:48.910
Come on.
He wants to see you.

00:18:50.477 --> 00:18:53.262
I still wear the pendant
you got me, Holga.

00:18:53.436 --> 00:18:56.874
I use it to sneak around
the castle sometimes.

00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:01.531
So strange that you're here.
Hey, Kir, look.

00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:07.407
I want you to know I am so sorry
for how things turned out.

00:19:08.059 --> 00:19:09.626
I took a risk.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.193
And it didn't pay off.

00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:13.195
Why do you look mad at me?

00:19:14.979 --> 00:19:17.330
Because you're acting like
it wasn't your fault.

00:19:18.113 --> 00:19:19.549
There they are!

00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:22.596
Oh!

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.293
Old friends.

00:19:24.467 --> 00:19:27.122
What a wonderful surprise. Come.

00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:31.996
Oh?

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:35.043
Do I spy a little bit of gray?

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:36.392
I do. I like it.

00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:38.829
It's scoundrelly
but professorial.

00:19:39.003 --> 00:19:41.571
You look like a...
What do you look like?

00:19:41.745 --> 00:19:44.748
You look like a well-read
fisherman with secrets.

00:19:46.707 --> 00:19:48.099
And Holga.

00:19:49.057 --> 00:19:51.059
I know you don't like hugs.

00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:52.887
But I need one. Yes?

00:19:53.757 --> 00:19:56.020
- Oh.
- Mmm. Mmm.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.805
Mmm! Mmm.

00:19:57.979 --> 00:20:00.373
These last years
must have been dreadful,

00:20:00.547 --> 00:20:03.027
but I tell you what,
I did think you'd serve longer.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:07.858
Oh! Uh, we... We got an...
early release.

00:20:08.032 --> 00:20:09.817
Good behavior. Yeah, behaving good.

00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:11.819
Ah. I see.

00:20:11.993 --> 00:20:14.213
Well, welcome. Welcome back.

00:20:15.388 --> 00:20:17.520
Oh, that's blistering.
That's blisteringly hot.

00:20:17.694 --> 00:20:19.087
Yet again.

00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:21.568
Kira, we really should speak
to the kitchen staff,

00:20:21.742 --> 00:20:24.092
because there's simply no need
for it to be this hot.

00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:28.096
Yeah, yeah, the tea's hot. So, how
are you the Lord of Never winter?

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:33.623
Right. Before you went off to prison,
you charged me with Kira's well-being.

00:20:33.797 --> 00:20:35.234
Didn't think much of it
at the time.

00:20:35.408 --> 00:20:38.280
But there came a moment
when I looked into her eyes,

00:20:38.454 --> 00:20:40.935
and I suddenly knew
I had to be a better man.

00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:43.807
Obviously, I couldn't give back
the treasures we'd stolen,

00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:45.766
so when Lord Neverember
fell ill,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.770
I seized the chance to try and,
you know, make a difference.

00:20:49.944 --> 00:20:52.314
And the money from Korinn's Keep
paved the way for my campaign.

00:20:52.338 --> 00:20:54.165
But I will tell you this...

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.231
Couldn't have done it alone.

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.474
Ah! And here she is!

00:20:58.648 --> 00:21:00.607
You remember Sofina.

00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:03.349
You're still working with her?
She's the one that got us caught.

00:21:03.523 --> 00:21:06.787
Not true, no. Without her,
we all would have been caught.

00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:08.832
And since then,
she has become...

00:21:09.616 --> 00:21:12.314
my top adviser. Mmm.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.884
The tea is scorching, I do apologize.
It's scorching hot.

00:21:17.406 --> 00:21:19.234
Um, Sofina.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.672
Would you mind very much, um...

00:21:23.325 --> 00:21:24.587
Certainly.

00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:29.939
Hmm.

00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:32.291
Good. Thank you. I... I'm...

00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:36.033
I didn't realize you were gonna
put your finger in the cup, so...

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.949
I'm gonna leave that for later.

00:21:39.123 --> 00:21:42.518
Well, if you'll give us the tablet,
Kira, Holga and I will be on our way.

00:21:42.692 --> 00:21:45.782
Of course that's why
you came back.

00:21:45.956 --> 00:21:48.219
No, it wasn't for me. It was
for that Tablet of Riches.

00:21:48.394 --> 00:21:49.830
Riches?

00:21:50.004 --> 00:21:53.268
No, it 's... it's
the Tablet of Reawakening.

00:21:53.442 --> 00:21:54.522
I'm sorry, what's this now?

00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:57.141
The reason why
I agreed to the heist.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:00.014
Is that what he's told you?
That I left you for more riches?

00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:02.669
I told her the truth.
She has a right to know it.

00:22:04.192 --> 00:22:05.846
He's been lying to you, Kira.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.979
I wanted to... I wanted
to bring your mother back.

00:22:09.153 --> 00:22:11.895
Oh, Ed, come on. Look, I know how
much you crave her forgiveness,

00:22:12.069 --> 00:22:13.810
but I promise you,
more lies is not the way.

00:22:13.984 --> 00:22:15.638
You snake!

00:22:15.812 --> 00:22:18.075
You know damn well
what he was after.

00:22:18.249 --> 00:22:20.861
Why wouldn't you tell me
if you were doing it for Mom?

00:22:21.035 --> 00:22:23.820
Because I didn't want you
to lose her again if I failed.

00:22:23.994 --> 00:22:26.606
But you can't blame the poor
girl for distrusting you.

00:22:27.171 --> 00:22:28.216
After all,

00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:33.308
you have been lying since you set
foot in the room, haven't you?

00:22:38.618 --> 00:22:41.142
- You escaped?
- We were trying to get back to you, Bug.

00:22:41.316 --> 00:22:42.622
Kira, look at me.

00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:45.712
I swear to you, it was
a Tablet of Reawakening.

00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:48.671
I was doing it for Mom, for all of us.
You have to trust me.

00:22:48.845 --> 00:22:51.848
You told me to trust you
when you left me.

00:22:55.199 --> 00:22:56.940
Kira, no, wait, wait!
Kira!

00:22:57.114 --> 00:22:58.554
Give her time,
give her time.

00:22:58.725 --> 00:23:01.510
She's had years to resent you
for your absence.

00:23:01.684 --> 00:23:04.121
And you've had years
to poison her against me.

00:23:04.295 --> 00:23:05.601
No, that is not true.

00:23:06.602 --> 00:23:08.212
We very rarely
spoke of you at all.

00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:11.302
Give him what he came for. The tablet?

00:23:11.477 --> 00:23:13.740
I don't think
I will be returning it.

00:23:14.654 --> 00:23:16.960
Or your daughter,
for that matter.

00:23:17.134 --> 00:23:18.397
You bastard!

00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:27.144
And now you're in the floor!

00:23:27.318 --> 00:23:29.495
Oh, I hate to see that.

00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:33.281
Sofina really is a very,
very powerful wizard!

00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:37.241
You'd have thought that you'd have learned
that the last time she trapped you.

00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:40.549
You always wanted us
to get caught.

00:23:40.723 --> 00:23:44.771
No, I wanted you and Simon to get
caught, but he managed to escape somehow.

00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:48.644
All these years together, and you
double-cross us for this witch?

00:23:48.818 --> 00:23:51.038
Never put your trust
in a con man.

00:23:51.212 --> 00:23:52.213
Save for this...

00:23:52.387 --> 00:23:54.171
Kira really is happy

00:23:54.345 --> 00:23:55.695
and very well
taken care of here,

00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:58.698
and I have truly come
to love her as my own.

00:23:58.872 --> 00:24:03.006
I never actually saw the appeal of
being a father till I became one.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.706
But to have another person
look up to you

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.665
and allow you to shape them
in your own image.

00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:11.711
It's a bit like a god!

00:24:11.885 --> 00:24:16.193
Well, hang on, I'm a god and a lord.
I am really doing all right!

00:24:16.367 --> 00:24:17.673
Black wood?

00:24:17.847 --> 00:24:20.197
Could you possibly
return them to prison?

00:24:20.371 --> 00:24:22.069
And be sure
to collect the bounty.

00:24:22.243 --> 00:24:24.332
Well, I must away.

00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:27.727
I am expecting two of the wealthiest
men from Baldur's Gate and Water deep

00:24:27.901 --> 00:24:30.991
to talk about the High
Sun Games, which are back!

00:24:31.165 --> 00:24:32.906
So there's something, isn't it?

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.430
It was genuinely lovely
to see you both.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.825
Ah! Ah!

00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:40.609
Holga! Holga! Holga!

00:24:43.351 --> 00:24:45.092
Kill both of them.

00:24:51.402 --> 00:24:53.796
We got to get her out
of there. We will.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.320
But we need to think
of our own hides right now.

00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:59.280
- Yeah, you got this, right?
- I know you don't.

00:24:59.454 --> 00:25:01.021
On your knees.

00:25:05.982 --> 00:25:07.201
Handsome blade.

00:25:08.202 --> 00:25:10.204
Is that the work
of Ghelryn Foehammer?

00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:12.031
How did you know?

00:25:12.119 --> 00:25:13.773
The inlay on the haft.

00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:16.645
Oh.

00:25:16.819 --> 00:25:18.778
How's the weight? Does it parry?

00:25:19.953 --> 00:25:21.128
It's dark steel.

00:25:21.302 --> 00:25:22.477
Mmm. Very nice.

00:25:22.651 --> 00:25:24.000
Now put your heads down.

00:25:25.828 --> 00:25:27.090
Wait!

00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:28.744
What do you clean it with?

00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:31.965
You're about to lose your head.

00:25:32.139 --> 00:25:33.836
This is what
you're concerned with?

00:25:34.663 --> 00:25:36.535
If you wouldn't mind.

00:25:38.493 --> 00:25:41.757
Boiled linseed oil.
Once a month.

00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.934
Should be once a week. That's why
you're getting rust on the bit.

00:25:46.196 --> 00:25:48.764
Okay, chop it off. Chop
it off, let's do it.

00:25:57.164 --> 00:25:58.165
Get her!

00:26:11.047 --> 00:26:12.135
Stop her!

00:26:16.183 --> 00:26:18.359
Oh, we got 'em now!

00:26:45.386 --> 00:26:48.519
- Before we leave the city...
- Get boiled linseed oil, I know.

00:26:55.222 --> 00:26:56.615
Knock, knock.

00:26:57.964 --> 00:27:00.357
I wanted to make sure
you were all right.

00:27:03.578 --> 00:27:05.711
I knew I'd see him again
one day.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.758
I just hoped
it would be different.

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.500
Well, you have
to understand that

00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:15.416
when he lost your mother,

00:27:16.199 --> 00:27:17.897
he sort of lost himself.

00:27:20.987 --> 00:27:22.989
Why did he lie about the tablet?

00:27:24.555 --> 00:27:27.994
Maybe he was ashamed to admit how
much he'd given up for so little.

00:27:31.432 --> 00:27:33.086
I should probably go
speak to him.

00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:37.438
What?

00:27:37.612 --> 00:27:39.745
Well, he's gone, my dear.
He's gone.

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:42.443
I gave him
the Tablet of Riches and...

00:27:43.923 --> 00:27:45.098
he left.

00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:50.930
Holga, too?

00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:54.194
I'm sorry.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.939
And I want you to know that
even if he isn't there for you,

00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:02.071
I always will be.

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:04.857
I know.

00:28:05.945 --> 00:28:08.208
The fact that
you see good in me,

00:28:08.382 --> 00:28:11.124
makes me believe that there
might just be some in there.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.519
We could shoot an arrow
with a message into her room.

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:19.480
What if it hits her? That
's a risk we're gonna have to take.

00:28:19.654 --> 00:28:23.005
Killing my daughter with
an arrow? No, it's not.

00:28:23.179 --> 00:28:26.226
Even if she got the message, she
wouldn't come. She thinks of...

00:28:26.966 --> 00:28:28.794
Forge as her dad.

00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:33.059
We have to get into that castle
and take her out ourselves.

00:28:33.233 --> 00:28:35.539
That's crazy, Ed.

00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:38.431
Castle Never's tighter than Korinn's Keep,
and you know what happened with that.

00:28:38.455 --> 00:28:40.457
We're gonna need a team.

00:28:40.631 --> 00:28:42.372
Team?
Who's gonna help us out?

00:28:42.546 --> 00:28:45.941
We have nothing
to pay them with. Yeah, but Forge does.

00:28:46.115 --> 00:28:48.615
He said the richest people were
coming to bet on the High Sun Games.

00:28:48.639 --> 00:28:51.251
There'll be a fortune
in that vault.Yeah.

00:28:51.425 --> 00:28:53.383
Not to mention the tablet.

00:28:53.557 --> 00:28:54.820
And then Kira will know that...

00:28:54.994 --> 00:28:57.474
We abandoned her
for the right reason.

00:28:58.693 --> 00:29:02.610
I wouldn't put it like that,
but, uh, yeah. Yeah.

00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:05.004
Who do we get for this team?

00:29:05.178 --> 00:29:07.310
You know, I wonder
if Simon's still in Triboar.

00:29:07.484 --> 00:29:09.617
Simon's a terrible sorcerer.

00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:12.446
We haven't seen him in two years.
I'm sure he's gotten better.

00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:17.103
No one can hold a candle
to this trick.

00:29:21.281 --> 00:29:24.414
How about this one? You people
like the smell of fresh-cut grass?

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.160
Smell that?
It's fresh-cut grass.

00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:33.728
My five-year-old can
do that magic.

00:29:33.902 --> 00:29:35.774
But can he do this?

00:29:38.864 --> 00:29:40.300
Boo.

00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:42.171
He hasn't gotten better.

00:29:42.345 --> 00:29:44.347
I don't think it's about
what he's doing up there.

00:29:44.521 --> 00:29:47.481
This is quite hard to be
slightly blurry like this, you know.

00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:50.092
Anyone can be very blurry,
but to be slightly blurry,

00:29:50.266 --> 00:29:51.790
that's the real magic.

00:29:53.139 --> 00:29:54.140
Is that...

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.624
What? What was...

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:03.192
Hey!

00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:05.238
He's nickin' our bits and bobs!

00:30:05.412 --> 00:30:07.457
It's not what you think.
It's all part of the act.

00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:08.763
He's lying.

00:30:08.937 --> 00:30:10.286
Get him!

00:30:15.465 --> 00:30:16.640
Shield spell!

00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:18.164
Shield spell!

00:30:25.693 --> 00:30:28.348
That wasn't a shield spell.

00:30:43.493 --> 00:30:45.931
I am not loving this show.

00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:50.936
You're a dead man!

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.652
- Simon?
- Holga!

00:31:11.826 --> 00:31:14.133
- Staying for an encore?
- Get me out of here.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.929
I could've warned you
Forge was a prick.

00:31:28.103 --> 00:31:30.279
Soon as we left that vault,
Sofina tried to kill me

00:31:30.453 --> 00:31:32.107
and he just stood by.

00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:34.562
You know, there's rumors she
made Lord Neverember fall ill

00:31:34.718 --> 00:31:36.111
to clear the way for Forge.

00:31:36.285 --> 00:31:37.983
Her magic is
on a whole other level.

00:31:38.157 --> 00:31:40.637
Don't sell yourself short.
We saw your show.

00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:43.292
Yeah, you can hit her with
that fresh-cut grass trick.

00:31:43.466 --> 00:31:44.946
That's funny.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.122
Look, I don't blame you
for wanting to save Kira,

00:31:47.296 --> 00:31:50.038
and I love the idea of
knocking Forge off his perch,

00:31:50.212 --> 00:31:52.127
but robbing Castle Never
isn't worth the risk.

00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:53.955
And robbing your audience is?

00:31:55.739 --> 00:31:58.264
How broke are you? Desperately.

00:31:58.438 --> 00:32:00.614
I was planning on sleeping
in the theater tonight,

00:32:00.788 --> 00:32:03.051
but now that seems imprudent. So?

00:32:03.225 --> 00:32:06.141
Do we even know what sort of arcane
magic is protecting the vault?

00:32:06.315 --> 00:32:07.708
We're gonna find out! How?

00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:09.971
You gonna sneak past
the entire Castle Watch?

00:32:10.145 --> 00:32:13.105
Me? No.
A druid maybe, a Wild Shape.

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:15.846
They could get in and out
undetected as a...

00:32:16.021 --> 00:32:18.675
As a mouse or a... A deer.

00:32:18.849 --> 00:32:21.809
Yes, a deer! It'll blend in with
all the other deer in the castle.

00:32:21.983 --> 00:32:23.028
Don't mock me.

00:32:23.767 --> 00:32:25.291
Where can we find a druid?

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.642
I know a druid. Doric.

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:30.861
She's truly one of a kind.

00:32:31.558 --> 00:32:33.299
Sounds romantic in nature.

00:32:33.473 --> 00:32:35.431
Yeah. For me it was.

00:32:35.605 --> 00:32:39.696
She, however, found my lack
of self-esteem unattractive.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.394
Not your best trait.

00:32:41.568 --> 00:32:42.743
Thank you.

00:32:45.398 --> 00:32:47.922
In the name
of Forge Fitzwilliam,

00:32:48.096 --> 00:32:52.796
the prisoner is hereby sentenced
to death by dismemberment,

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:56.887
for the crime of speaking ill
of our leader.

00:32:57.062 --> 00:32:59.673
The Emerald Enclave
will never relent!

00:32:59.847 --> 00:33:01.588
Justice cannot be killed!

00:33:01.762 --> 00:33:03.372
On my command.

00:33:03.546 --> 00:33:05.437
Your Doric's a bit of a
radical. Ready?

00:33:05.461 --> 00:33:06.593
Oh, no, that's not Doric.

00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:09.726
Move in!

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.989
Kill her!

00:33:18.648 --> 00:33:20.041
Move in!

00:33:21.216 --> 00:33:22.696
Move in!

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.132
That's her.

00:33:37.972 --> 00:33:40.018
What is that again? It's an owlbear.

00:34:13.355 --> 00:34:16.315
- How high is this place?
- It's just up here.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.013
Stay where you are! Wait! Wait! It's me!

00:34:19.709 --> 00:34:21.668
Simon. Simon who?

00:34:21.842 --> 00:34:22.886
Ouch.

00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:26.368
Simon Aumar. Sorcerer.

00:34:26.542 --> 00:34:28.414
I courted you.

00:34:29.197 --> 00:34:30.851
You said I made you feel sad.

00:34:31.025 --> 00:34:33.897
Not from anything I did,
just from who I was.

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:35.421
Oh.

00:34:36.857 --> 00:34:38.250
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:34:38.424 --> 00:34:39.903
What are you doing here?

00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:42.297
We need a deer. We don't need a deer.

00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:44.386
We're gonna take down
Forge Fitzwilliam.

00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:52.220
So, how'd you come to live here?

00:34:52.394 --> 00:34:55.702
I was born to humans who decided
they didn't want a tie fling child.

00:34:55.876 --> 00:34:58.139
Uh-huh. The wood elves took me in.

00:34:58.313 --> 00:35:00.141
I joined the Emerald Enclave
to protect them.

00:35:00.315 --> 00:35:01.882
That's all the more reason
to join us.

00:35:02.056 --> 00:35:04.493
You're the only one who can
get into that castle unseen

00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:06.191
and tell us what
we're dealing with.

00:35:06.365 --> 00:35:08.889
As you can imagine,
I don't trust humans.

00:35:09.063 --> 00:35:11.457
I find you to be
hateful and selfish.

00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:14.503
Well, I'm finding you to be
a little mean.

00:35:14.677 --> 00:35:16.505
If it helps,
I'm only half-human.

00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:17.941
But you're a bad sorcerer.

00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:20.292
No, Simon...
He's a mighty sorcerer!

00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:23.077
He's a descendant
of Elminster Aumar.

00:35:23.251 --> 00:35:27.212
The only way to succeed in this is to
have confidence that it can be done.

00:35:27.386 --> 00:35:29.649
He doesn't.Yeah, I suppose that's fair.

00:35:29.823 --> 00:35:33.914
Look, Simon may not have my wit
or Holga's strength,

00:35:34.088 --> 00:35:36.177
but when it counts,
this young man delivers.

00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:39.180
It's why I chose him. He's
also the only sorcerer you know.

00:35:39.354 --> 00:35:40.703
Holga, not helpful.

00:35:40.877 --> 00:35:43.402
What is it exactly
that you bring to this?

00:35:43.576 --> 00:35:48.015
Me? I'm a planner. You know?
I make plans.

00:35:48.189 --> 00:35:51.236
You've already made the plan,
so what value do you have now?

00:35:52.715 --> 00:35:56.937
If, uh, the plan fails... the
existing plan... I make a new plan.

00:35:57.111 --> 00:35:58.460
So you make plans that fail.

00:35:58.634 --> 00:36:00.070
No.He also plays the lute.

00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:03.117
Holga, not relevant.
Trust me, I'm indispensable.

00:36:06.773 --> 00:36:08.557
Well,

00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:11.908
none of the plans we've tried
to take down Forge have worked.

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:15.782
We dared to question
how he came to power,

00:36:15.956 --> 00:36:17.697
so he declared us enemies.

00:36:19.089 --> 00:36:21.570
Began destroying our homes

00:36:21.744 --> 00:36:23.920
and executing our people.

00:36:25.444 --> 00:36:27.533
If we don't stop Forge soon,

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.231
there'll be nothing left
to defend.

00:36:33.669 --> 00:36:35.149
I'm not doing this
for the money.

00:36:36.759 --> 00:36:39.806
I'm doing this for the people who
took me in when no one else would.

00:36:40.894 --> 00:36:42.678
So we'll keep your share then.

00:36:47.553 --> 00:36:50.556
I sense your impatience.

00:36:52.384 --> 00:36:53.472
Szass Tam.

00:36:54.734 --> 00:36:58.694
But you have always been
the disciple I rely on most.

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:02.394
Doff your cowl.

00:37:02.568 --> 00:37:04.526
You needn't hide your sigils
from me.

00:37:07.094 --> 00:37:09.139
I'd rather be flensed and flayed

00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:12.186
than spend another hour
with Forge Fitzwilliam.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.233
The man is insufferable.

00:37:17.626 --> 00:37:21.369
But we never would have come
this far without his 'charm.'

00:37:22.588 --> 00:37:26.156
The living have befouled
this world long enough.

00:37:27.636 --> 00:37:31.684
Take solace in knowing that your
work here is nearly complete.

00:37:34.339 --> 00:37:35.557
There you are!

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.431
With your hood off, I notice.

00:37:40.606 --> 00:37:42.521
Probably best to keep that on.

00:37:42.695 --> 00:37:45.045
You know,
you Red Wizards of Thay

00:37:45.219 --> 00:37:48.353
are not as popular as you
should be outside Thay.

00:37:48.527 --> 00:37:52.270
And, of course, you're about
to be considerably less popular.

00:37:53.793 --> 00:37:58.580
But far, far be it from me ever
to tell you what to do.

00:37:58.754 --> 00:38:00.365
Caldwell and Piradost
have arrived.

00:38:00.539 --> 00:38:02.932
I was gonna give them...

00:38:03.106 --> 00:38:05.935
Awful, isn't it? I really have to
do something about these chairs.

00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:07.633
They're, uh...

00:38:09.374 --> 00:38:12.594
Now, I think you will find that we
have taken every imaginable measure

00:38:12.768 --> 00:38:15.031
to protect the assets
that you may... or may not...

00:38:15.205 --> 00:38:17.730
Choose to wager
during the High Sun Games.

00:38:17.904 --> 00:38:21.124
We have new portcullises
on every wing of the castle.

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:22.865
If the alarm is raised,

00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:26.216
nobody gets in or out.

00:38:28.088 --> 00:38:30.743
And then there is...

00:38:30.917 --> 00:38:32.875
the vault itself.

00:38:34.181 --> 00:38:37.532
My chief adviser, Sofina,
can give you all the details.

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:43.799
It is protected by
the Arcane Seal of Mordenkainen.

00:38:50.197 --> 00:38:51.546
Well, uh...

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.376
Perhaps not
all the details, but, uh,

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.379
suffice to say it is
a seriously powerful spell.

00:38:58.553 --> 00:39:01.469
Might I inquire, what prompted
you to resume the games?

00:39:01.643 --> 00:39:03.906
Lord Neverember considered
them quite brutal.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.126
Lord Neverember and I are
very different men.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.302
For example, I prefer
to be up and about.

00:39:08.476 --> 00:39:10.348
He prefers to be
in a vegetative state.

00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:13.438
You are terrible.

00:39:14.439 --> 00:39:16.354
I can be naughty. No, I...

00:39:16.528 --> 00:39:19.705
The truth is that the games bring
the city together like nothing else.

00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:25.624
And it is not the role of government
to deny the people what they crave.

00:39:25.798 --> 00:39:29.889
Or to deny you rich bastards
the right to profit off them.

00:39:32.108 --> 00:39:34.154
Now who wants refreshments?

00:39:34.328 --> 00:39:35.634
Silence!

00:39:38.637 --> 00:39:41.204
A Wild Shape is among us.

00:40:09.842 --> 00:40:11.104
Hey!

00:40:11.278 --> 00:40:12.540
Stop!

00:40:19.895 --> 00:40:21.419
I can't grab her!

00:42:15.707 --> 00:42:18.057
So she did become a deer.

00:42:18.231 --> 00:42:19.885
Only at the very end.

00:42:20.059 --> 00:42:22.714
Are you absolutely sure
about Sofina? I saw her markings.

00:42:22.888 --> 00:42:24.846
No wonder I couldn't counter
her Time Stop.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.110
Forge knew all along. He's got my
daughter in there with a Red Wizard.

00:42:28.284 --> 00:42:32.375
The vault is protected by something
called 'Morty Kamen's Arcane Seal.'

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.768
Mordenkainen?

00:42:33.942 --> 00:42:36.162
Yeah, that's it. Oh, pity.

00:42:36.336 --> 00:42:38.338
What? If the vault has
Mordenkainen's Seal,

00:42:38.512 --> 00:42:40.072
we're not getting in.
It's impenetrable.

00:42:40.209 --> 00:42:41.733
Can't you just open it
with magic?

00:42:41.907 --> 00:42:43.778
Okay, here we go.

00:42:43.952 --> 00:42:47.216
I hate how everyone thinks that you
can solve any problem with magic.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.350
There are limits.
This isn't some bedtime story.

00:42:50.524 --> 00:42:53.309
This is the real world. So
there's no way to open it?

00:42:53.483 --> 00:42:57.531
No, I mean, if I were one of the
world's most powerful sorcerers, so, no.

00:42:57.705 --> 00:42:59.402
Or if we had
the Helm of Disjunction.

00:42:59.968 --> 00:43:01.491
The what?

00:43:01.666 --> 00:43:03.706
It's a helmet that disables
all nearby enchantments.

00:43:03.842 --> 00:43:06.496
But it doesn't matter. The thing
went missing ages ago. We're done.

00:43:06.671 --> 00:43:08.890
Huh? Come on.

00:43:09.064 --> 00:43:11.893
What's the problem?
We can find that helmet.

00:43:12.067 --> 00:43:15.505
Even if we did, I couldn't use it without
attuning to it, which I'm terrible at.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.551
You can do it.
I know you can.

00:43:17.725 --> 00:43:20.225
You saying that doesn't make it so.
Yeah, but you saying it does.

00:43:20.249 --> 00:43:21.468
But I can't.But you can.

00:43:21.642 --> 00:43:22.730
But I won't.Just say it.

00:43:22.904 --> 00:43:23.992
No! Fine.

00:43:24.166 --> 00:43:25.864
Can we just keep this
between us?

00:43:26.038 --> 00:43:28.867
I don't want to hurt
the group's morale. What morale?

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.479
Holga knows where the helmet is. You do?

00:43:32.653 --> 00:43:35.656
My tribe fought the Cult of the
Dragon over it at the Evermoors.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.615
We could just ask them
where it went.

00:43:37.789 --> 00:43:39.965
That battle was a century ago.
They're all dead.

00:43:40.139 --> 00:43:42.097
So? Ask them with magic.

00:43:42.271 --> 00:43:44.902
He just made a whole speech how he
can't fix everything with magic.

00:43:44.926 --> 00:43:46.406
Actually,
that is something I can do.

00:43:47.668 --> 00:43:49.148
You can bring back the dead?

00:43:49.322 --> 00:43:51.280
I can't, uh, bring them back,

00:43:51.454 --> 00:43:54.153
but I have this token that lets
me ask corpses some questions,

00:43:54.327 --> 00:43:55.807
and then they go back
to being dead.

00:43:55.981 --> 00:43:58.070
Yuck. Yeah, it's fairly horrible.

00:43:58.244 --> 00:44:00.507
It's fairly wonderful.

00:44:00.681 --> 00:44:04.076
We're off to the Evermoors.
Thank you, Simon, for the drinks.

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:05.599
Oh, what? No...

00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:07.732
Just pay it with magic.

00:44:25.967 --> 00:44:30.537
The Wild Shape must be in
league with Forge's former partners.

00:44:30.711 --> 00:44:33.148
Perhaps Forge is
working against us?

00:44:33.322 --> 00:44:35.324
As long as he profits,

00:44:35.498 --> 00:44:37.892
he will not interfere
with Szass Tam's conquest.

00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:39.894
I will find these thieves.

00:44:40.068 --> 00:44:41.853
Before you go,

00:44:42.027 --> 00:44:45.073
the men behind us
allowed them to escape.

00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:46.901
Understood.

00:44:48.424 --> 00:44:50.252
He's a Thayan!

00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:15.713
Hey, Ed.

00:45:16.888 --> 00:45:18.585
Huh? Look where we are.

00:45:19.629 --> 00:45:21.109
Marlamin? Really?

00:45:21.283 --> 00:45:23.155
Why would you do that
to yourself?

00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:25.548
I'm just gonna pick up
some of my things.

00:45:30.858 --> 00:45:32.773
He painted the shutters.

00:45:33.382 --> 00:45:34.557
Pretty.

00:45:43.044 --> 00:45:44.045
Holga!

00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:45.873
Hello, Marlamin.

00:45:46.047 --> 00:45:48.267
- That's Marlamin?
- Oh, yeah.

00:45:48.441 --> 00:45:51.531
We were all a little surprised
the first time we met him.

00:45:52.488 --> 00:45:54.577
I thought your sentence
was longer.

00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:56.275
I busted out of there.

00:45:59.452 --> 00:46:01.236
Same old Holga.

00:46:03.412 --> 00:46:05.153
So what have you been up to?

00:46:05.327 --> 00:46:07.068
Oh.

00:46:07.242 --> 00:46:08.678
The usual.

00:46:08.853 --> 00:46:11.159
I've got my garden.
I'm working on my book.

00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:14.032
I see you still have that
walking stick I gave you.

00:46:14.206 --> 00:46:16.643
Yeah. Yeah.

00:46:16.817 --> 00:46:18.906
Well, you can take it with you
if you want.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.952
Gwinn's not much for rambling. Gwinn?

00:46:21.126 --> 00:46:22.799
You home, darling? In here.

00:46:22.823 --> 00:46:26.218
Oh! Squashed a pack
of bullywugs down at the...

00:46:26.392 --> 00:46:27.785
Oh. Hello.

00:46:27.959 --> 00:46:30.309
Who's this, then? Oh, Gwinn, this is Holga.

00:46:30.918 --> 00:46:32.224
Oh.

00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:34.139
Heard a lot about you.

00:46:34.313 --> 00:46:36.097
I'd shake your hand,
but, uh...

00:46:36.271 --> 00:46:37.271
Pleasure.

00:46:37.316 --> 00:46:39.057
How long you in town for?

00:46:39.231 --> 00:46:40.667
Um, just passing through.

00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:43.148
Gonna talk to some corpses
south of Nesmé.

00:46:43.322 --> 00:46:44.802
Oh. Great, yeah.

00:46:46.542 --> 00:46:49.067
Gonna get washed up for supper.
What we having?

00:46:49.241 --> 00:46:51.286
I cured a goose and I
gathered some pickleberries.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:52.635
Mmm.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.681
Nice meeting you, Holga.Yeah.

00:46:58.772 --> 00:47:01.514
So how long have you two...
Going on a year.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.995
Does she make you happy?

00:47:04.169 --> 00:47:05.692
Happier than I did?

00:47:07.476 --> 00:47:09.914
Well, I'll put it this way:
She makes her living honestly.

00:47:10.088 --> 00:47:12.568
She doesn't drink herself silly.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.486
And she doesn't make me weep
in the small hours,

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.358
wondering where she is.

00:47:19.532 --> 00:47:21.055
I was in pain.

00:47:21.229 --> 00:47:23.797
I was banished from my
damn tribe to be with you.

00:47:23.971 --> 00:47:26.974
And I tried to build us a home
so you could forget that.

00:47:29.498 --> 00:47:30.717
But you never could.

00:47:34.068 --> 00:47:35.809
Gwinn seems lovely.

00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:38.159
You deserve that.

00:47:38.333 --> 00:47:39.552
Thank you.

00:47:40.814 --> 00:47:43.382
You know, when you left,
I lost my family.

00:47:45.384 --> 00:47:48.039
I've been fortunate enough
to find another.

00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:52.652
And I wish nothing less
than that for you.

00:47:56.221 --> 00:47:58.136
My sweet, old Ho-Ho.

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.240
We're gonna take down Forge.

00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:20.245
I'm gonna show Marlamin and the Elk
tribe they were fools to let me go.

00:49:39.628 --> 00:49:43.154
So many of my kin gave
their lives in battle here.

00:49:44.938 --> 00:49:48.681
I'd always imagined I'd be buried
in sacred ground like this.

00:49:48.855 --> 00:49:49.899
Yeah.

00:49:50.596 --> 00:49:52.293
Anyone got a shovel?

00:49:58.604 --> 00:50:01.085
Okay, Simon, how does this work?

00:50:01.259 --> 00:50:04.001
I read the incantation
on this cleric's token.

00:50:04.175 --> 00:50:05.480
Should be here somewhere.

00:50:05.654 --> 00:50:07.613
Here!

00:50:07.787 --> 00:50:11.182
All right. Once the dead man is
revived, we can ask him five questions,

00:50:11.356 --> 00:50:14.315
at which point he will die
again, never to be re-revived.

00:50:14.489 --> 00:50:16.274
Why five questions?

00:50:16.448 --> 00:50:18.121
I don't know,
that's just how it works. Seems arbitrary.

00:50:18.145 --> 00:50:20.800
Can we get on with this, please?
Right, yes.

00:50:29.243 --> 00:50:30.331
Delightful.

00:50:42.952 --> 00:50:44.345
Maybe I'm not saying it right.

00:50:48.654 --> 00:50:50.264
I wasn't scared,
merely startled.

00:50:51.135 --> 00:50:53.441
Here we go.

00:50:54.964 --> 00:50:56.923
Were you killed in
the Battle of the Evermoors?

00:50:57.097 --> 00:50:58.968
Yes. Great!

00:50:59.143 --> 00:51:02.842
I mean, not for you.
Sorry for your loss.

00:51:03.016 --> 00:51:04.800
Four more questions, right?

00:51:04.974 --> 00:51:06.106
Yes.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.629
No. No, no,
that wasn't for you.

00:51:07.803 --> 00:51:08.963
Did that count as a question?

00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:11.111
- Yes.
- Damn it.

00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:14.680
Only answer when
I talk to you, okay?

00:51:14.854 --> 00:51:17.509
Yes. Why did you say 'okay?'
at the end of that?

00:51:17.683 --> 00:51:19.076
I didn't.

00:51:20.294 --> 00:51:21.861
Fantastic. Where's the shovel?

00:51:29.738 --> 00:51:31.000
Toke Horgath.

00:51:32.306 --> 00:51:35.831
During the battle, did you see
the Helmet of Disjunction?

00:51:36.005 --> 00:51:40.140
It was in possession of my
chief, Stan hard Grimwulf.

00:51:40.314 --> 00:51:42.011
Okay, good.

00:51:42.186 --> 00:51:44.188
And what did
Stan hard Grimwulf do with it?

00:51:46.146 --> 00:51:50.629
As the cultists breached the
ridge, we knew we outnumbered them.

00:51:50.803 --> 00:51:55.416
But our advantage meant nothing
against the dragon Rakor.

00:52:04.817 --> 00:52:06.123
Horgath!

00:52:06.732 --> 00:52:07.994
Horgath!

00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:11.084
Take this and run.

00:52:11.258 --> 00:52:13.869
Keep it from Rakor at all costs!

00:52:14.043 --> 00:52:15.654
Understood, sir.
Don't worry.

00:52:15.828 --> 00:52:18.135
That's the last thing
I remember.

00:52:22.617 --> 00:52:24.141
Oh. Yeah, well...

00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:26.578
Thanks for your help.

00:52:26.752 --> 00:52:28.928
Let's go look
for Stan hard Grimwulf's grave.

00:52:29.102 --> 00:52:30.712
Hang on! Hang on! Hmm?

00:52:30.886 --> 00:52:32.908
Aren't you going to ask him
the last three questions?

00:52:32.932 --> 00:52:34.997
Ask him what? He already
told us everything he knows.

00:52:35.021 --> 00:52:37.581
Well, you can't just leave him like that.
Look at the poor bloke.

00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:40.461
Oh, fine.

00:52:41.593 --> 00:52:42.811
What's your favorite food?

00:52:43.725 --> 00:52:45.640
Oats. No, barley!

00:52:45.814 --> 00:52:47.207
Oh, boy.

00:52:48.469 --> 00:52:49.514
Do you like cats?

00:52:49.688 --> 00:52:50.950
Not really.

00:52:51.124 --> 00:52:52.169
Okay.

00:52:52.821 --> 00:52:53.909
What's two plus two?

00:52:54.083 --> 00:52:55.389
I'm bad at math.

00:52:56.216 --> 00:52:57.348
Don't you feel better? No.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.482
Oftentimes,

00:53:01.656 --> 00:53:04.050
the most onerous decision
a leader can take

00:53:04.224 --> 00:53:05.965
is when to retreat.

00:53:06.922 --> 00:53:08.663
I issued the order.

00:53:10.839 --> 00:53:13.625
I commanded my battle lord
to deliver the helmet

00:53:13.799 --> 00:53:16.062
to our swiftest rider,
Ven Salafin.

00:53:16.236 --> 00:53:18.369
If we can just make it
over the ridge, we can...

00:53:19.674 --> 00:53:21.154
Not again.

00:53:22.764 --> 00:53:25.158
It was the morning
of the battle.

00:53:26.899 --> 00:53:30.294
As I stepped out my bath,
my foot slipped on the stone.

00:53:34.298 --> 00:53:36.169
And then you went into
the battle?

00:53:36.343 --> 00:53:39.738
No. I died. From the fall.

00:53:39.912 --> 00:53:42.784
But Stan hard Grimwulf said he
gave the helmet to Ven Salafin.

00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:44.786
That's you, isn't it?

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.137
I'm Sven Salafin.
Ven's my brother.

00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:50.575
This is a nightmare.

00:53:50.749 --> 00:53:52.011
Is Ven all right?

00:53:54.622 --> 00:53:57.059
I was wounded
and had lost my horse

00:53:57.234 --> 00:53:58.844
as I escaped
the field of battle.

00:53:59.018 --> 00:54:01.412
I didn't care about myself.

00:54:01.586 --> 00:54:03.805
I just needed
to keep the helmet safe.

00:54:13.641 --> 00:54:17.254
It was a Thayan,
who bore the mark of Szass Tam.

00:54:20.257 --> 00:54:22.389
I waited for the killing blow.

00:54:23.129 --> 00:54:24.478
But it never came.

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:27.481
He had a kind way.

00:54:27.655 --> 00:54:30.179
He told me
his name was Xenk Yendar.

00:54:30.354 --> 00:54:33.487
He had fled Szass Tam
and now lived in exile.

00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:37.448
As I died, he promised
to keep the helmet safe.

00:54:37.622 --> 00:54:39.580
And for some reason,
I believed him.

00:54:39.754 --> 00:54:41.974
You're joking.
A 'kind' Thayan?

00:54:42.148 --> 00:54:43.148
I speak truth.

00:54:43.236 --> 00:54:44.672
You speak horseshit.

00:54:44.846 --> 00:54:47.022
That Thayan lied
and you died for nothing.

00:54:47.196 --> 00:54:49.996
The helmet's a dead end. We'll have
to find another way into the vault.

00:54:50.156 --> 00:54:52.071
No, I've heard of Xenk.

00:54:52.245 --> 00:54:54.615
He's a paladin. He helped the
Enclave defeat the Clerics of Talos.

00:54:54.639 --> 00:54:55.814
I know the name as well.

00:54:55.988 --> 00:54:57.548
My uncle said Xenk
fended off a Beholder

00:54:57.642 --> 00:54:59.165
using only a sharpened gourd.

00:54:59.339 --> 00:55:01.994
A sharpened gourd? Something sharp.

00:55:02.168 --> 00:55:05.345
The Thayans are murderers.
End of story.

00:55:07.347 --> 00:55:08.348
What?

00:55:08.522 --> 00:55:10.437
I've heard of him, too.No.

00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:13.310
He fought with my cousin in the Anauroch.
He says he's a good man.

00:55:13.484 --> 00:55:17.226
Well, you can all go find this lovely
Xenk and braid each other's hair.

00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:18.750
I'll find another way.

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:23.929
What's his problem? He's got a history
with the Thayans.

00:55:24.103 --> 00:55:28.325
I know how you're feeling.
But we're running out of time.

00:55:30.936 --> 00:55:32.764
I'd be betraying Zia.

00:55:32.938 --> 00:55:36.507
No, you wouldn't. You'd be
doing it to save her and Kira.

00:55:36.681 --> 00:55:39.161
Look, if Xenk turns out
to be a prick,

00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:41.207
I'll split him
right down the middle.

00:55:41.381 --> 00:55:44.645
That's very sweet. What
have we got to lose?

00:55:48.606 --> 00:55:50.521
Anyone know where
stupid Xenk is?

00:55:50.695 --> 00:55:53.480
Last I heard, he was working with
the Harpers in Mornbryn's Shield.

00:55:53.654 --> 00:55:55.482
Great! Harpers.

00:55:55.656 --> 00:55:57.310
What's his problem with Harpers?

00:55:57.484 --> 00:55:59.007
He's got a history
with them too.

00:55:59.181 --> 00:56:00.531
All right, let's go.

00:56:01.488 --> 00:56:02.663
Excuse me?

00:56:03.925 --> 00:56:05.405
I'm still alive.

00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:07.189
Right. Um...

00:56:08.495 --> 00:56:10.192
What's your favorite book?

00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:12.194
Mmm, hard to pick just one.

00:56:13.326 --> 00:56:14.545
Fifth question, right? Yep.

00:56:14.719 --> 00:56:16.677
Good. In terms of historical works,

00:56:16.851 --> 00:56:20.638
I'd say The Fanged Tome
of Lykanthus Szar.

00:56:22.074 --> 00:56:24.250
That was only
the fourth question.

00:56:24.946 --> 00:56:26.078
Hello?

00:56:27.296 --> 00:56:28.689
Oh, shit.

00:56:31.779 --> 00:56:33.346
Heave! Heave!

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.130
Come on,
we need more! Come on!

00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:10.905
It's alive!

00:57:13.125 --> 00:57:14.213
Thank you!

00:57:14.909 --> 00:57:16.258
Thank you, sir.

00:57:27.008 --> 00:57:29.402
He's interesting. I' ve
seen more interesting.

00:57:29.576 --> 00:57:31.448
Ed, go talk to him. You go talk to him.

00:57:31.622 --> 00:57:33.382
You know,
I've pulled cats out of fish.

00:57:42.067 --> 00:57:43.111
Xenk, is it?

00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.550
That is a query
I prefer not to answer

00:57:46.593 --> 00:57:48.247
without knowing
to whom I am speaking.

00:57:48.421 --> 00:57:49.901
I'm Holga Kilgore.

00:57:50.075 --> 00:57:53.165
This is Simon, Edgin
and Doric back there.

00:57:54.427 --> 00:57:57.386
And what brings you
to Mornbryn's Shield? You do.

00:57:57.561 --> 00:57:59.693
We're trying to find
the Helmet of Dysfunction.

00:57:59.867 --> 00:58:01.478
Disjunction.

00:58:01.652 --> 00:58:03.480
Many lives were lost
in defense of that helm.

00:58:03.654 --> 00:58:06.047
To speak of it would be
to diminish their sacrifice.

00:58:10.008 --> 00:58:11.139
Janklee.

00:58:12.227 --> 00:58:14.752
Jankleeto you as well, good sir.

00:58:19.104 --> 00:58:21.846
You're known as a man
of honor and integrity,

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:26.154
and I can assure you, our reasons for
wanting the helmet are entirely noble.

00:58:26.328 --> 00:58:27.808
Yep.
We're gonna rob someone.

00:58:27.982 --> 00:58:29.375
Holga!

00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:32.117
Not just anyone.
Forge Fitzwilliam.

00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:34.380
And the Red Wizard of Thay
he's partnered with.

00:58:36.338 --> 00:58:37.601
Come with me.

00:58:42.388 --> 00:58:43.781
What is this place?

00:58:43.955 --> 00:58:46.348
A Harper sanctuary.

00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:48.655
But surely your friend Edgin
already knew that.

00:58:50.222 --> 00:58:51.702
How'd you know I was a Harper?

00:58:51.876 --> 00:58:54.226
You may have forsworn your oath,

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:57.577
but your oath
hasn't forsworn you.

00:58:57.751 --> 00:59:01.755
Just because that sentence is
symmetrical doesn't make it not nonsense.

00:59:01.929 --> 00:59:03.757
Why do you wish
to rob Fitzwilliam?

00:59:03.931 --> 00:59:06.586
He stole Edgin's daughter and a
great deal of treasure from us.

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.066
Also a Tablet of Reawakening.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.894
He doesn't need to know
all that.

00:59:10.068 --> 00:59:11.417
I was just...

00:59:11.591 --> 00:59:13.462
In other words,
Forge is a real son of a bitch.

00:59:13.637 --> 00:59:15.639
So you blame his mother
for his corruption.

00:59:15.813 --> 00:59:17.075
What?

00:59:17.249 --> 00:59:18.772
No, it's an expression.

00:59:18.946 --> 00:59:20.557
I see.

00:59:20.731 --> 00:59:22.776
I do not traffic
in colloquialisms.

00:59:23.734 --> 00:59:25.518
You're not a lot of fun,
are you?

00:59:25.692 --> 00:59:27.912
If Fitzwilliam is truly
allied with a Red Wizard,

00:59:28.086 --> 00:59:31.611
their intentions must go
beyond the mere political.

00:59:31.785 --> 00:59:34.048
Over a century ago,
the necromancer Szass Tam

00:59:34.222 --> 00:59:36.877
was one of eight zulkirs
who ruled the nation of Thay.

00:59:37.051 --> 00:59:38.313
Great, a history lesson.

00:59:38.487 --> 00:59:40.577
But Tam's hunger for power
was absolute.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.015
On the eve of the solstice,

00:59:44.189 --> 00:59:47.192
residents of the capital gathered
for a celebration.

00:59:52.458 --> 00:59:56.114
Unbeknownst to them,
or his fellow rulers,

00:59:56.288 --> 00:59:58.159
Tam had a plan of his own:

00:59:59.117 --> 01:00:01.510
To stage an unholy coup.

01:00:27.798 --> 01:00:30.191
He unleashed
the Beckoning Death,

01:00:30.365 --> 01:00:33.891
a spell that would consume the
souls of all who beheld it,

01:00:34.065 --> 01:00:36.763
enslaving them to his will.

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:38.809
With the aid of his Red Wizards,

01:00:38.983 --> 01:00:41.986
Szass Tam created an army
of the undead,

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.337
allowing him to conquer
the entire nation.

01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:51.822
Szass's power extends no further
than the borders of Thay.

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:54.041
I suspect he and his Red Wizards
will not be content

01:00:54.215 --> 01:00:57.218
until they have infected the whole
of Faerûn with their maleficence.

01:00:57.392 --> 01:00:59.917
You done? Because we already
know that Red Wizards are bad.

01:01:00.091 --> 01:01:01.658
And so does Forge.

01:01:01.832 --> 01:01:03.592
The question remains, if they
helped him to take power,

01:01:03.616 --> 01:01:04.791
what do they stand to gain?

01:01:04.965 --> 01:01:06.880
Sounds like we have
a common enemy.

01:01:07.054 --> 01:01:08.934
You give us that helmet,
and we take Forge down.

01:01:08.969 --> 01:01:11.015
No one stays Lord without
a fortune to back him up.

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:12.886
And the Red Wizards
lose their puppet.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.193
What will become
of the wealth you burgle?

01:01:15.367 --> 01:01:17.151
What does that matter?

01:01:17.325 --> 01:01:19.806
I will not be complicit in the
illicit use of ill-gotten booty.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.158
Uh... Fine. We'll divide it
amongst the townspeople.

01:01:24.332 --> 01:01:26.421
Swear to it. What?

01:01:26.595 --> 01:01:28.380
Place your hand
on this Harper's Seal

01:01:28.554 --> 01:01:31.688
and swear that you will indeed
distribute all the wealth you take

01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:33.777
amongst the people
of Never winter.

01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:36.388
Sure, fine.

01:01:40.087 --> 01:01:41.610
Go on, Ed.

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:44.309
Promise you'll give
Forge's money to the people.

01:01:49.967 --> 01:01:51.751
Promise I'll...

01:01:51.925 --> 01:01:54.449
give Forge's money
to the people of Never winter.

01:01:54.623 --> 01:01:56.147
Keep this.

01:01:57.322 --> 01:02:00.804
You may not yet
believe your words, but I do.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.286
Yeah. Good for you.
Simon, hold onto this.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.940
Now, where's the helmet?

01:02:07.114 --> 01:02:09.638
In the bowels of the Under dark.
The Under dark?

01:02:09.813 --> 01:02:11.878
Weren't you trying to keep it safe?
Why would you put it down there?

01:02:11.902 --> 01:02:14.742
Because it is the last place that
anyone who values their life would go.

01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:16.254
Sounds lovely. Quite the opposite.

01:02:16.428 --> 01:02:18.952
I-I know. I was being ironic.

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:22.826
I find irony is a blade that cuts
he who wields it most especially.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.872
Yeah?
Is that what you find, Xenk?

01:02:26.046 --> 01:02:28.005
There is an entrance east
of the Sword Mountains

01:02:28.179 --> 01:02:29.615
in the Kryptgarden Forest,

01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:32.792
from which we may descend
to the ruins of Dolblunde.

01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:37.884
If I may be so bold, what caused
you to renounce the Harpers?

01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:42.976
Being a Harper
got my wife killed.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:45.283
I'm sorry.

01:02:45.457 --> 01:02:47.198
Did her assailants find justice?

01:02:47.372 --> 01:02:48.982
The Thayans, you mean?

01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:51.550
No.

01:02:51.724 --> 01:02:53.726
The Thayans
are not all malevolent.

01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:57.730
I was a boy when Szass Tam
seized control of Thay.

01:03:00.951 --> 01:03:02.996
I saw firsthand
the horrors of the spell.

01:03:04.345 --> 01:03:07.087
Honorable men
turned to monsters.

01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:10.221
Minds wiped clean in moments.

01:03:10.395 --> 01:03:13.964
Parents
turning on their own child.

01:03:34.245 --> 01:03:36.813
I escaped, alive,

01:03:38.031 --> 01:03:40.207
but forever changed.

01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:43.994
You and I have both lost
a part of ourselves.

01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:46.910
All that matters is what
we do with what remains.

01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:49.434
I told you what I'm gonna do.

01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:51.848
I'm gonna break into Castle
Never and get my family back.

01:03:52.263 --> 01:03:53.481
And the tablet?

01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:55.832
You plan to resurrect
your wife.Yeah.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.096
Very well.

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:02.162
I'd only ask that you consider that this
plane we call 'life' is but one of many.

01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:03.404
Uh-huh.

01:04:03.578 --> 01:04:05.537
To drag your lady-love
back to her old life

01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:07.321
is to deprive her
of her new one.

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:10.150
Can someone else
ride next to this guy?

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.509
Follow me to the orifice.

01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:26.427
The orifice?

01:04:28.038 --> 01:04:30.562
The Under dark
has many entrances.

01:04:33.304 --> 01:04:35.567
This is one of
the less conspicuous.

01:04:43.357 --> 01:04:44.706
I'll go last.

01:04:46.534 --> 01:04:49.886
It's a day's trek. I've chosen
a path to avoid the populace.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.453
Stay close and quiet.

01:04:52.627 --> 01:04:56.675
Whatever you've heard of this place is
merely a fraction of its true danger.

01:04:58.242 --> 01:05:00.244
Should the way become too dim,

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:03.334
you may take my hand,
and I will lead you.

01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:08.992
I'll tell you right now,
I'm not taking his hand.

01:05:20.438 --> 01:05:23.267
Keep your guard up.
I don't trust this guy.

01:05:24.137 --> 01:05:26.270
Even though he's helping us?

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:28.794
Ah, he's got something
up his sleeve.

01:05:28.968 --> 01:05:31.188
The only thing up my sleeve
is my arm.

01:05:31.362 --> 01:05:34.104
How could he hear that?
I hear that as well.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:35.932
I hate you.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.296
The path to the ruins
is just here.

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:01.695
Keep still!

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:06.614
Rochnon.

01:06:06.788 --> 01:06:09.617
Intellect devourers.
Small but formidable.

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:13.534
They stun their targets and consume
the brain, taking control of the body.

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:15.667
What do we do? Make no sound.

01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:18.975
They're drawn to mental energy.

01:06:19.149 --> 01:06:23.457
The higher the intelligence of the prey,
the more likely they are to strike.

01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:42.346
Well, that's a little hurtful.

01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:47.307
There it is.
The Hanging City of Dolblunde.

01:06:48.526 --> 01:06:52.356
The helmet lies on the far side
of this chasm.

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:56.882
But be warned, the bridge is
protected by an ancient Gnomish trap.

01:06:57.056 --> 01:07:00.277
There is a precise formula we must follow
so as not to trigger the mechanism.

01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:03.280
What's the formula? It's quite simple.

01:07:03.454 --> 01:07:05.891
Starting from the center,
use odd-numbered blocks only,

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:08.385
moving forward with each step,
except for every fifth step,

01:07:08.502 --> 01:07:09.662
which must be a lateral move.

01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:11.462
Left or right, it matters not,

01:07:11.636 --> 01:07:13.744
so long as the leader and the
laggard remain equidistant.

01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:16.771
After which, proceed.
Again, odd-numbered blocks only.

01:07:16.945 --> 01:07:20.036
However, at the midpoint we
switch to even-numbered blocks.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.908
Same pattern, except now a lateral
move after the fourth step,

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:25.258
until we reach the three...

01:07:33.527 --> 01:07:35.181
I...

01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:37.140
I may have...

01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:39.446
put my foot on the bridge.

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.927
Didn't realize that's where
it technically started.

01:07:44.669 --> 01:07:47.019
So... sorry.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.071
It's not very
structurally sound.

01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:59.858
Can't you just magic us across?

01:08:00.032 --> 01:08:02.817
It's too far for telekinesis.

01:08:02.991 --> 01:08:05.603
I've got some rope in my bag.

01:08:05.777 --> 01:08:07.344
I could tie it to the axe.

01:08:07.518 --> 01:08:09.694
Toss it across
so it sticks to the rock.

01:08:09.868 --> 01:08:13.263
You know rocks are
hard, right? Shut up.

01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:14.742
Where did you get that?

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:17.571
What, Marlamin's walking stick?

01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:19.965
I swiped it from a wizard
over in the Grey peaks.

01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:21.967
That's not a walking stick.

01:08:23.621 --> 01:08:25.188
It's a Hither-Thither staff.

01:08:25.362 --> 01:08:28.191
A what? Should have a range
of around 500 yards.

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:30.802
Watch.

01:08:30.976 --> 01:08:32.108
Hither.

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.284
Thither.

01:08:36.329 --> 01:08:38.853
It works!

01:08:41.334 --> 01:08:42.553
See?

01:08:43.554 --> 01:08:45.643
Didn't even need the bridge!

01:08:46.557 --> 01:08:47.862
I did good.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.213
Good save.

01:09:30.818 --> 01:09:35.693
This I give you now, trusting that you
will protect it with your very life.

01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:37.521
I will.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.350
Hold this.

01:09:45.006 --> 01:09:46.878
There is evil here.

01:09:58.977 --> 01:10:00.108
Are those...

01:10:00.935 --> 01:10:02.241
Thayan assassins.

01:10:02.415 --> 01:10:05.505
You look older, Yendar.

01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:08.813
Must be all that
foul mortal blood.

01:10:08.987 --> 01:10:13.948
And you, Dralas, look just as
loathsome as the last time we met.

01:10:14.122 --> 01:10:19.302
Then I'll see to it
we don't meet again.

01:10:19.476 --> 01:10:21.478
Leave them to me.

01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:56.268
I'm glad he's on our side.

01:12:00.141 --> 01:12:01.141
We must flee.

01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:02.927
Why? You killed them all.

01:12:03.101 --> 01:12:05.712
'Tis no simple feat to kill
that which is already dead.

01:12:10.717 --> 01:12:12.850
Ready for the next bout, Yendar?

01:12:15.156 --> 01:12:16.810
Quickly!

01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:06.817
That's one pudgy dragon.

01:13:06.991 --> 01:13:10.168
It's Themberchaud.
He must have found a new den.

01:13:10.342 --> 01:13:11.822
Did he eat the last one?

01:14:29.116 --> 01:14:30.204
I got you!

01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:43.174
It's a dead end!

01:14:43.957 --> 01:14:45.829
Simon! Up there!

01:15:38.011 --> 01:15:39.230
Thanks for that.

01:15:40.187 --> 01:15:41.972
You'd have done the same for me.

01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:44.714
Yeah.

01:15:47.281 --> 01:15:48.848
Bastard won't quit!

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:01.644
Come on! He's stuck!

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.080
So are we.

01:16:10.435 --> 01:16:12.263
We're gonna drown!

01:16:12.437 --> 01:16:15.527
Well, portal us out of here! I can
only portal us to what I can see!

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:17.381
You want to go from
that wall to that wall?

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.663
It's salt water.

01:16:20.837 --> 01:16:23.579
Simon, you remember that trick
you did in Triboar?

01:16:23.753 --> 01:16:24.753
Fresh-cut grass smell?

01:16:24.884 --> 01:16:27.191
No, the flame finger one.

01:16:27.365 --> 01:16:29.106
Yeah, why? Holga, hit him!

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.108
You want to make him angrier?

01:16:31.282 --> 01:16:33.676
When I say so,
everybody goes underwater.

01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:36.287
And that'll be your cue, Simon,
all right?

01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:38.071
What are you looking at?

01:16:38.245 --> 01:16:41.074
A Harper shaking off
his slumber.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:43.599
Go, Holga!

01:16:48.342 --> 01:16:49.517
Again!

01:16:52.738 --> 01:16:53.738
Now!

01:17:32.517 --> 01:17:33.953
This is where I leave you.

01:17:34.127 --> 01:17:36.303
I wish you every success
on your journey.

01:17:38.479 --> 01:17:40.438
You're not coming? Would that I could.

01:17:40.612 --> 01:17:43.049
But this is your quest.

01:17:43.223 --> 01:17:46.574
I have given you the tools.
You must utilize them.

01:17:46.749 --> 01:17:48.402
Can't you utilize them for us?

01:17:48.576 --> 01:17:51.101
Because you're much better
at fighting and strategy and...

01:17:51.275 --> 01:17:53.669
Pretty much everything
but talking.

01:17:55.366 --> 01:17:56.497
Talking to you isn't great.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:57.760
Mmm.

01:17:59.457 --> 01:18:02.765
In those instances where
faith wanes and doubt waxes,

01:18:02.939 --> 01:18:04.419
I recall
the Tenets of the Ancients...

01:18:04.592 --> 01:18:06.333
Okay. See you later.

01:18:21.914 --> 01:18:23.263
There he goes.

01:18:25.483 --> 01:18:27.093
Just wandering off.

01:18:28.616 --> 01:18:30.967
Walks in such a straight line.

01:18:32.142 --> 01:18:34.057
Uh-oh. Wait a minute.
He's coming up on a rock.

01:18:34.231 --> 01:18:36.407
Is he gonna go around?

01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:37.843
Nope.

01:18:38.017 --> 01:18:39.845
Right over the rock.

01:18:47.113 --> 01:18:48.854
What are you mumbling?

01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:51.161
I'm preparing to attune.

01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:53.990
If I can't connect with it,
it'll be useless.

01:18:55.469 --> 01:18:58.211
That's a lot of pressure, given
all we went through to get it.

01:18:58.385 --> 01:18:59.952
Yeah, I realize that.

01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:04.348
So our entire fate rests on you.

01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:07.133
Come on.

01:19:30.113 --> 01:19:33.507
There he is,
the great Simon Aumar.

01:19:33.681 --> 01:19:36.597
Sorcerer descended
from wizarding blood.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.034
Who are you?

01:19:38.686 --> 01:19:40.166
Don't you know me?

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.909
My name is Aumar too.

01:19:45.606 --> 01:19:46.999
You're my
great-great grandfather.

01:19:50.568 --> 01:19:52.657
That's quite a helm.

01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:55.616
What makes you think
you're worthy of it?

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.445
I believe in myself?

01:19:58.619 --> 01:20:00.056
You're asking me?

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:02.319
No, I'm... I'm sure.

01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:04.103
I'm a great sorcerer.

01:20:04.277 --> 01:20:05.626
Are you now?

01:20:06.627 --> 01:20:08.673
Funny thing about magic.

01:20:09.717 --> 01:20:12.068
It chooses who may wield it.

01:20:12.242 --> 01:20:14.548
And it does not suffer fools.

01:20:14.722 --> 01:20:16.072
Why are you telling me this?

01:20:16.246 --> 01:20:19.336
I think you know, Simon.

01:20:24.036 --> 01:20:25.516
Did you attune with it?

01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:26.996
You okay?

01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:28.649
I got you.

01:20:29.912 --> 01:20:31.478
What happened?

01:20:31.652 --> 01:20:32.871
I, uh...

01:20:33.045 --> 01:20:35.134
- I spoke to someone.
- Yeah?

01:20:35.308 --> 01:20:37.180
My great-great grandfather.
He was...

01:20:38.224 --> 01:20:38.964
unhelpful.

01:20:39.138 --> 01:20:41.097
You spoke to him?

01:20:41.271 --> 01:20:43.989
From here, it looked like the helmet
flew off the second you put it on.

01:20:44.013 --> 01:20:45.841
Well, time moves
differently there.

01:20:46.015 --> 01:20:47.843
Okay,
I'll try a different approach.

01:20:48.017 --> 01:20:50.019
Great. New approach. Try it.

01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:52.760
You got this.
You got this.

01:20:59.289 --> 01:21:01.465
You're getting better.
You didn't fly as far.

01:21:01.639 --> 01:21:03.032
Stick with it.

01:21:03.206 --> 01:21:04.923
We have six hours till
we leave for Never winter.

01:21:04.947 --> 01:21:06.818
You fail, I never
get my family back.

01:21:06.992 --> 01:21:08.080
Brilliant.

01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:29.449
I've never seen a bigger coward.

01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:32.061
Coward?
You're under here, too.

01:21:32.713 --> 01:21:33.932
Fine. I'll handle it.

01:21:34.106 --> 01:21:35.891
No, no, no.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.545
I've got this.

01:21:40.852 --> 01:21:43.159
And you want to be a Harper.

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:44.595
Quiet!

01:21:48.991 --> 01:21:51.167
Oh, God. Damn.

01:21:51.776 --> 01:21:53.082
There it is.

01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:56.694
Stop trying to capture it.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.613
You just have to let it go.

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:05.137
Ed!

01:22:06.138 --> 01:22:08.575
Ed! We've got a problem.

01:22:08.749 --> 01:22:10.142
I can't do it.

01:22:11.187 --> 01:22:12.971
- The helmet?
- I've been at it for hours!

01:22:13.145 --> 01:22:14.930
I can't get past
the old bastard!

01:22:15.104 --> 01:22:17.410
I said I couldn't attune.
Now I'm the prat!

01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:19.108
What's the racket?

01:22:19.282 --> 01:22:21.458
He's having
a little trouble with the helm.

01:22:21.632 --> 01:22:23.721
Come on, Simon, just do it.

01:22:23.895 --> 01:22:27.116
Oh. Yeah, okay. Yeah.
Thanks, Holga. I'll just do it.

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:30.075
This is exactly what I told you
would happen back at the tavern,

01:22:30.249 --> 01:22:33.078
but you wouldn't listen. What
do you mean, you told him?

01:22:33.252 --> 01:22:35.167
He said to keep it
between us for morale.

01:22:35.341 --> 01:22:36.952
I... Do you know why?

01:22:37.126 --> 01:22:39.955
Because he is the most pigheaded
person I've ever known!

01:22:40.129 --> 01:22:42.261
You talk us into doing things
you know won't work,

01:22:42.435 --> 01:22:44.481
and then you blame us
when it goes pear-shaped!

01:22:44.655 --> 01:22:46.918
If you can't attune,
we'll figure out a Plan B.

01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:48.659
Plan B?
We dug up my family.

01:22:48.833 --> 01:22:50.617
We went to the Under dark
for that helmet.

01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:53.142
And you knew the whole time
that he couldn't use it?

01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:55.100
You humans.
You just can't help but lie.

01:22:55.274 --> 01:22:57.973
I didn't lie. I really
thought Simon could do it.

01:22:58.147 --> 01:23:01.063
Guys, look. We got a couple
hours till the games begin.

01:23:01.237 --> 01:23:03.413
This is what we do.
We pivot.

01:23:03.587 --> 01:23:06.111
Instead of dwelling on what
went wrong and who lied to whom,

01:23:06.285 --> 01:23:08.285
let's put our heads together
and figure out a plan!

01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:10.246
I'm gonna figure out
my way home.

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.509
I can't believe I put
my faith in any of you.

01:23:12.683 --> 01:23:15.468
Yeah, I'm going too.
Sorry about Kira.

01:23:17.905 --> 01:23:20.473
We'll find another way
to get her. Just not today.

01:23:20.647 --> 01:23:23.694
It has to be today. We're not
done until my daughter's safe.

01:23:23.868 --> 01:23:25.043
Aren't you sick of failing?

01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:27.176
No! That's the whole point!

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:31.571
We must never stop failing, because
the minute we do, we've failed.

01:23:32.398 --> 01:23:34.313
Huh? Look,

01:23:34.487 --> 01:23:38.535
none of us here can say our lives
have gone the way we had hoped for.

01:23:39.101 --> 01:23:40.145
Right?

01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:41.712
Holga.

01:23:41.886 --> 01:23:43.844
You left your tribe
to be with a man

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:47.587
who left you because you were so
upset about leaving your tribe.

01:23:47.761 --> 01:23:50.068
And if you quit now,
that's in stone!

01:23:50.242 --> 01:23:52.114
Same with you, Simon.

01:23:52.288 --> 01:23:55.291
You're a petty thief masquerading
as a pettier sorcerer.

01:23:55.465 --> 01:23:58.033
You gonna go back to your show?
It's better than dying.

01:23:58.207 --> 01:23:59.817
There's worse things than dying.

01:23:59.991 --> 01:24:01.906
And, Doric, you have integrity,

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.040
and I am sure the last thing you want
to do is tell the Emerald Enclave

01:24:05.214 --> 01:24:07.564
that you had a chance to save
them but you walked away.

01:24:07.738 --> 01:24:10.436
Hey, You're quick to call us failures.
What about you, Ed?

01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:14.136
Me? I'm the champion
of failures!

01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:17.400
I lost everything that ever mattered
to me and it was all my fault.

01:24:23.406 --> 01:24:25.625
You want to know who
really killed my wife?

01:24:28.498 --> 01:24:29.629
I did.

01:24:31.283 --> 01:24:34.547
I decided we deserved a better life
than a Harper's oath would allow us.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:39.857
But I didn't know that Red
Wizards marked their treasure.

01:24:42.555 --> 01:24:44.383
I led them right to our door.

01:24:46.994 --> 01:24:50.128
I didn't even have the good luck
to be home when they got there.

01:24:51.738 --> 01:24:54.741
I failed the Harpers, I failed
my family, I failed all of you.

01:24:54.915 --> 01:24:56.787
Which is exactly why
I can't quit.

01:24:56.961 --> 01:24:59.659
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go sit on this rock

01:25:00.617 --> 01:25:02.097
and make a plan.

01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:16.154
Move over.

01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:54.366
I 'd sit too, but there's
no more room on the rock.

01:25:56.847 --> 01:25:58.109
How about this?

01:25:59.415 --> 01:26:01.721
We use the Hither-Thither Staff
to get into the vault.

01:26:01.895 --> 01:26:03.462
No, I've explained this.

01:26:03.636 --> 01:26:05.484
You can't Hither-Thither
into a room you can't see.

01:26:05.508 --> 01:26:06.944
I'm not saying that.

01:26:07.118 --> 01:26:09.425
I'm saying we put
the portal on something

01:26:09.599 --> 01:26:11.775
and then sneak that thing
into the vault.

01:26:11.949 --> 01:26:15.082
Mmm. The only thing going
in that vault is treasure.

01:26:15.257 --> 01:26:17.650
So we put the portal
on some treasure.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.829
Forge did say the richest men
in Baldur's Gate and Water deep

01:26:23.003 --> 01:26:24.788
are bringing loot to the city.

01:26:25.789 --> 01:26:27.704
They'll be traveling
the High Road.

01:26:27.878 --> 01:26:30.291
We could catch one of their convoys!
There'll be dozens of guards.

01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:32.119
Yeah, but the guards will
be guarding against people

01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:34.972
taking things out of their
wagon, not putting them in!

01:26:35.146 --> 01:26:37.409
Holga, I could kiss you! Try it.

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:43.937
Perfect.
Thank you so much.

01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:01.450
Oh!

01:28:28.041 --> 01:28:29.086
Oh!

01:29:06.384 --> 01:29:11.215
What a profound joy
it is to welcome you,

01:29:11.389 --> 01:29:15.175
the good people of Never winter,
to the resumption

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:18.004
of the High Sun Games!

01:29:21.878 --> 01:29:25.185
I guarantee that you are in for
the most riveting spectacle

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.362
on all the Sword Coast.

01:29:27.536 --> 01:29:29.799
The rules are very simple:

01:29:29.973 --> 01:29:33.977
Five harrowing challenges.
Five teams of champions.

01:29:34.151 --> 01:29:37.372
Whoever survives to reach
the Cage of Sanctuary

01:29:37.546 --> 01:29:40.462
moves on to the next stage.

01:29:41.288 --> 01:29:43.465
One thing: I do urge you,

01:29:43.639 --> 01:29:47.643
please do not leave the arena
till the close of the games,

01:29:47.817 --> 01:29:50.080
as there will be
a wonderful gift

01:29:50.254 --> 01:29:53.257
for each and every one of you!

01:29:58.871 --> 01:30:00.351
All right, take me down.

01:30:00.525 --> 01:30:02.614
This is absurdly high.
It's not what we discussed.

01:30:04.964 --> 01:30:07.227
Come on.
Gotta get it all done.

01:30:16.715 --> 01:30:18.674
Oh, no. What happened?

01:30:18.848 --> 01:30:21.503
It's facing the floor. Why
would they store it that way?

01:30:28.161 --> 01:30:29.815
Damn it. Why does nothing
go our way?

01:30:29.989 --> 01:30:31.774
Let me try.
Maybe I can make a gap.

01:30:33.384 --> 01:30:34.907
The games have started.

01:30:36.213 --> 01:30:39.085
We 're going to Plan C.Oh, bollocks.
What's Plan C?

01:30:39.259 --> 01:30:41.653
Plan C is we go back to Plan A.

01:30:41.827 --> 01:30:43.147
You're gonna attune
to the helmet.

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:45.265
Why don't you
just call it Plan A?

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.288
Plan A has a stink on it. You know
damn well I can't attune to the thing.

01:30:48.312 --> 01:30:50.619
That's not true!
You couldn't attune to it.

01:30:50.793 --> 01:30:53.012
Look at me.
Look at me! Huh?

01:30:53.186 --> 01:30:54.884
Do you remember that job
in Loudwater?

01:30:55.058 --> 01:30:58.017
You couldn't spider climb until
Jolym sicced his dog on you.

01:30:58.191 --> 01:31:00.150
And when we robbed
the spear of Aoth Fezim,

01:31:00.324 --> 01:31:03.240
your stone skin spell failed until
the arrows were inches away.

01:31:03.414 --> 01:31:07.026
Even in Triboar, you flipped
the gravity of a whole theater!

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.245
You did?

01:31:09.333 --> 01:31:11.074
By accident.
It was wild magic,

01:31:11.248 --> 01:31:14.294
and that only happened
because they were gonna kill me. Exactly!

01:31:15.252 --> 01:31:17.515
Look, you are at your strongest

01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:19.822
when you think
you're at your weakest.

01:31:19.996 --> 01:31:21.693
But you deliver.

01:31:23.434 --> 01:31:26.132
You're gonna get
into that vault, okay?

01:31:26.306 --> 01:31:27.830
Not because you can...

01:31:29.745 --> 01:31:30.963
but because you must.

01:31:31.834 --> 01:31:33.836
I'm gonna keep chipping away.

01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:36.641
If I can get a quarter inch, I'll be
able to squeeze through as a worm.

01:31:36.665 --> 01:31:37.883
As a worm!

01:31:38.057 --> 01:31:39.494
As a worm, perfect.

01:31:39.668 --> 01:31:41.670
You see this? Now we have
a Plan D if Plan C fails.

01:31:41.844 --> 01:31:43.672
Isn't Plan D just Plan B again?

01:31:43.846 --> 01:31:46.936
Plan B has a stink too. It all stinks.

01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:49.547
Here. Use this
to keep in contact.

01:31:50.461 --> 01:31:52.071
Well, um, this is a rock.

01:31:52.245 --> 01:31:53.551
Actually it is...

01:31:53.725 --> 01:31:55.292
a sending stone.

01:31:55.466 --> 01:31:56.946
But they'll only work
for an hour.

01:31:57.773 --> 01:31:59.296
Clever.

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:03.126
So how we gonna get in there?

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:05.389
Easy.
We just create a distraction.

01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:08.697
Oh, I got a good feeling
about Plan C.

01:32:22.319 --> 01:32:24.060
What's your business here?

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:51.629
What's going on?
You're messing up my song!

01:32:51.653 --> 01:32:52.828
My foot is stuck.

01:32:53.002 --> 01:32:54.786
Concentrate, Simon.

01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.096
What madness is this?

01:33:05.667 --> 01:33:07.930
I think they're starting
to get suspicious.

01:33:11.063 --> 01:33:12.238
Nine hells.

01:33:13.675 --> 01:33:15.764
There! Interlopers! Come on!

01:33:23.815 --> 01:33:25.556
Kira's room should be up there.

01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:28.341
Find the vault
and we'll meet you. Go!

01:33:28.515 --> 01:33:29.515
Halt!

01:33:37.133 --> 01:33:39.154
- There she is!
- Hold your weapons!

01:33:39.178 --> 01:33:40.789
I'll hold them.
Find the vault.

01:33:40.963 --> 01:33:43.269
You sure I can't help? I'm certain.

01:33:43.443 --> 01:33:45.837
Mmm, you don't
have to be so certain. Get her!

01:34:17.826 --> 01:34:20.480
Now listen carefully.

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:23.179
I'm with the Absolution Council.
They've just gone up.

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:46.202
Go! Quickly!

01:35:06.396 --> 01:35:07.440
Open up!

01:35:07.614 --> 01:35:09.399
Just a minute!

01:35:29.245 --> 01:35:30.463
I don't mind that.

01:35:33.815 --> 01:35:35.294
Okay, you can do this.

01:35:35.468 --> 01:35:37.079
Relax. No rush.

01:35:37.253 --> 01:35:38.820
There he is!

01:35:42.432 --> 01:35:44.913
Look who's back.
The would-be sorcerer.

01:35:45.087 --> 01:35:48.525
I don't have time for this! Yet I have
all the time there is.

01:35:48.699 --> 01:35:51.049
You don't get it. We're going
to die if I don't attune!

01:35:51.223 --> 01:35:54.183
So you die a fool.
It's better than to live as one.

01:35:54.357 --> 01:35:56.054
That's enough!
You don't know me.

01:35:56.228 --> 01:35:58.970
I know you're a stain
on your family name!

01:35:59.144 --> 01:36:01.016
To hell with my name!
Let me attune!

01:36:01.190 --> 01:36:03.540
Not while I live. You don't live!

01:36:03.714 --> 01:36:05.847
You had your time.
Now it's my turn.

01:36:06.021 --> 01:36:07.196
I won't allow it.

01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:08.675
I don't care!

01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:11.635
Sorry.

01:36:16.161 --> 01:36:17.336
Took you long enough.

01:36:33.657 --> 01:36:34.701
Simon!

01:36:36.181 --> 01:36:37.269
Simon, was that you?

01:36:37.443 --> 01:36:39.576
It was! I did it!

01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:40.969
Well done.

01:36:42.013 --> 01:36:43.754
I guess it was just me
holding me back.

01:36:43.928 --> 01:36:45.364
That's what I' ve been saying!

01:36:54.243 --> 01:36:55.461
I made it inside the vault.

01:36:55.635 --> 01:36:57.289
So did we.

01:36:58.290 --> 01:36:59.988
There's nothing here.

01:37:00.162 --> 01:37:02.599
What do you mean?
It's all here. Where are you?

01:37:02.773 --> 01:37:03.818
Where are you?

01:37:04.601 --> 01:37:06.037
I think I'm under the arena.

01:37:07.996 --> 01:37:08.996
Forge.

01:37:09.127 --> 01:37:10.476
This one here.

01:37:28.755 --> 01:37:30.235
Oh, that's not good.

01:37:38.722 --> 01:37:40.680
Simon! Doric! You there?

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.378
What are you doing here?

01:37:43.292 --> 01:37:44.293
Kir!

01:37:46.469 --> 01:37:47.687
I came for you.

01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:49.254
We have to go.

01:37:50.168 --> 01:37:51.691
You left me.

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:55.347
No. No, I know you think
I'm a liar and a bad father,

01:37:55.521 --> 01:37:56.958
but...

01:38:00.352 --> 01:38:01.876
I am a bad father.

01:38:05.227 --> 01:38:07.011
And I did leave you.

01:38:07.185 --> 01:38:09.361
And I wasn't trying
to bring your mom back.

01:38:09.535 --> 01:38:10.972
I was trying to...

01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:13.583
bring my wife back.

01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:17.892
Which if... maybe if you had
gotten a chance to know her

01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:21.417
and love her like I did,
you'd understand.

01:38:21.591 --> 01:38:23.419
But if you come with me now,

01:38:24.333 --> 01:38:25.900
you can have that chance.

01:38:28.859 --> 01:38:29.859
Hmm.

01:38:48.096 --> 01:38:50.837
You 'd think you'd be
able to distinguish between

01:38:51.012 --> 01:38:53.623
your own daughter
and a 300-year-old wizard.

01:38:53.797 --> 01:38:55.016
Don't worry, Kira's safe.

01:38:55.190 --> 01:38:56.974
Unlike me, she had no idea
you were coming.

01:38:57.148 --> 01:39:00.760
I don't think she knows how
tenacious you've become. Huh?

01:39:02.284 --> 01:39:03.850
Look, Ed, um...

01:39:06.853 --> 01:39:09.465
I'm really sorry about the
way things have worked out.

01:39:10.466 --> 01:39:12.729
But I think if you were
truly honest,

01:39:12.903 --> 01:39:15.819
you'd have to admit I can
give Kira a better life.

01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:18.430
I hope you can
take comfort in knowing

01:39:18.604 --> 01:39:20.737
that she's with the father
she deserves, yeah?

01:39:20.911 --> 01:39:23.566
And now I'm in
a pickle because...

01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.655
I don't want to see you die.

01:39:26.917 --> 01:39:30.486
Which is why
I'm gonna leave the room.

01:39:33.184 --> 01:39:34.184
What?

01:39:42.802 --> 01:39:45.283
If you're gonna kill us, at
least let us die with dignity.

01:39:45.457 --> 01:39:48.460
How do you mean? Put us
in the High Sun Games.

01:39:48.634 --> 01:39:51.028
Give us a fighting chance.
That's not a chance.

01:39:51.202 --> 01:39:52.987
It's not a chance at all.

01:39:53.161 --> 01:39:56.077
I mean, even if you were to
somehow survive the tournament,

01:39:56.251 --> 01:39:57.687
Sofina's gonna...

01:40:00.690 --> 01:40:03.998
It would be much, much better for you
to die here than to go to the games.

01:40:04.172 --> 01:40:07.566
No. They defeated
your men and mine.

01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.394
Let them fight in the arena.

01:40:10.265 --> 01:40:12.223
They deserve that much.

01:40:14.617 --> 01:40:16.880
To the games?

01:40:17.054 --> 01:40:20.275
Oh. Yeah.
That was sort of a bad day.

01:40:20.449 --> 01:40:21.493
Oh.

01:40:21.667 --> 01:40:23.191
You might want
to go back to sleep.

01:40:23.365 --> 01:40:24.540
Are we...

01:40:24.714 --> 01:40:26.716
In the arena.

01:40:28.587 --> 01:40:31.242
This dummy talked Forge into
putting us in the games.

01:40:31.416 --> 01:40:33.114
Dummy? I saved our lives!

01:40:33.288 --> 01:40:35.266
And I got us right above where
Doric said the treasure was.

01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:37.770
Isn't it a little suspect
that Sofina would agree to this?

01:40:37.944 --> 01:40:40.817
Yeah, she's definitely
planned something.

01:40:40.991 --> 01:40:42.732
Where under the arena were you?

01:40:43.428 --> 01:40:44.777
Do you remember?

01:40:45.561 --> 01:40:46.649
Not sure.

01:40:47.998 --> 01:40:49.739
There was a dock down there.

01:40:49.913 --> 01:40:52.742
I saw guards loading
everything onto a ship.

01:40:54.657 --> 01:40:58.443
A ship. Forge wasn't hiding
the loot from us.

01:40:58.617 --> 01:41:00.576
He was stealing it for himself.

01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:03.622
He never cared about being Lord. That
just gave him access to the vault.

01:41:03.796 --> 01:41:06.316
He must have brought back the
games so the take would be bigger.

01:41:07.931 --> 01:41:12.501
What about Kira? He won't leave her behind.
We have to get to that boat.

01:41:12.675 --> 01:41:16.461
I don't understand. If Forge is leaving,
what does Sofina get out of this?

01:41:24.948 --> 01:41:26.776
Maybe I can get us out of here.

01:41:30.214 --> 01:41:33.261
Magic suppression cuff.
They put one on me too.

01:41:33.435 --> 01:41:35.480
And just when you were
getting good at it.

01:42:36.237 --> 01:42:38.064
So we just go through the maze?

01:42:38.239 --> 01:42:40.154
I guess till we reach the cage?

01:42:46.290 --> 01:42:47.291
Run!

01:42:51.991 --> 01:42:53.167
Find the cage!

01:43:02.567 --> 01:43:03.655
Follow me!

01:43:13.796 --> 01:43:14.840
Whoa, whoa!

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:00.495
Thanks.

01:44:03.193 --> 01:44:05.587
- Where are the others?
- Come on, this way.

01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:13.334
Have you tried
Displacer Beast meat?

01:44:14.073 --> 01:44:15.858
No. It's too gamey for me.

01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:19.514
The ship is ready, sir.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.523
It seems my ship is ready, so...

01:44:29.524 --> 01:44:32.048
Kira and I will
be taking our leave.

01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:38.359
I do hope that our collaboration has been
as gratifying for you as it has for...

01:44:38.533 --> 01:44:40.491
Get out of my city.

01:44:40.665 --> 01:44:41.884
Right.

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.411
Get out of the way!

01:44:48.238 --> 01:44:49.413
It's burning!

01:44:55.027 --> 01:44:57.029
Another minute,
I would have lost my hand.

01:44:57.203 --> 01:44:58.814
Yeah, but look what
you did lose.

01:44:59.554 --> 01:45:00.554
Come on.

01:45:00.685 --> 01:45:02.470
Doric? Doric!

01:45:02.644 --> 01:45:04.776
There must be a way
to get out of the arena.

01:45:22.185 --> 01:45:23.534
Come on! Come on!

01:45:34.328 --> 01:45:35.459
Yeah. Come on!

01:45:37.243 --> 01:45:38.941
No.

01:45:39.115 --> 01:45:41.204
No, this isn't the way out.

01:45:41.378 --> 01:45:43.748
Yes, it is. If we survive this, there'll be
another challenge and another

01:45:43.772 --> 01:45:45.730
until every last person
in that cage is dead.

01:45:45.904 --> 01:45:47.732
We have to find a work-around.

01:45:50.126 --> 01:45:52.215
I've got an idea. Follow me.

01:45:52.389 --> 01:45:53.695
No! Come back!

01:45:53.869 --> 01:45:56.132
Hey! What's your idea?

01:46:03.487 --> 01:46:05.097
When we hear the gong,
we jump in.

01:46:05.271 --> 01:46:06.490
Into this thing?

01:46:06.664 --> 01:46:08.536
You want to end up
like that guy?

01:46:08.710 --> 01:46:10.886
We will only be inside
for a few seconds.

01:46:14.324 --> 01:46:16.413
Well, If we're all inside,
who's gonna pull us out?

01:46:16.587 --> 01:46:18.589
- I will, trust me.
- Always.

01:46:18.763 --> 01:46:20.069
Hold.

01:46:23.289 --> 01:46:24.726
Hold.

01:46:26.771 --> 01:46:27.816
Hold!

01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:30.079
Now!

01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:05.506
Damn it! That stings!

01:47:16.386 --> 01:47:18.823
We got to move.

01:47:27.179 --> 01:47:28.398
I've been here.

01:47:29.051 --> 01:47:30.356
Our gear.

01:47:33.621 --> 01:47:35.927
Simon. Try these
on your cuff.

01:47:38.277 --> 01:47:39.627
Come with me.

01:47:41.237 --> 01:47:43.152
Quite a second date, yeah?

01:47:57.166 --> 01:47:59.081
- A trip?
- Yes.

01:47:59.255 --> 01:48:01.538
Something urgent has come up, but
if we leave now we'll be safe.

01:48:01.562 --> 01:48:02.563
Safe from what?

01:48:04.782 --> 01:48:07.306
What is this? This is an ambush.

01:48:07.481 --> 01:48:09.801
On the boat you were gonna use
to escape from Never winter.

01:48:09.874 --> 01:48:11.310
Dad. Hi, honey.

01:48:11.485 --> 01:48:13.791
Hey, Forge, why don't you
tell her what this is?

01:48:15.314 --> 01:48:18.187
I don't know. It's the
Tablet of Reawakening, Kira.

01:48:18.361 --> 01:48:20.276
It's the reason why I left you.

01:48:20.450 --> 01:48:22.408
Your dad's been
telling you the truth, Bug.

01:48:22.583 --> 01:48:25.063
It's Uncle Forge
who's been feeding you lies.

01:48:26.891 --> 01:48:29.198
It's rubbish.
It's just rubbish!

01:48:29.372 --> 01:48:30.852
Come with me, Kir.

01:48:31.809 --> 01:48:34.072
We'll go home, bring back Mom.

01:48:35.247 --> 01:48:37.206
We can be a family again.

01:48:40.905 --> 01:48:42.211
You're not taking my money.

01:48:44.082 --> 01:48:46.432
Put down the tablet and get off
my ship, all of you.

01:48:46.607 --> 01:48:48.652
Now! Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:48:48.826 --> 01:48:50.175
What are you doing?

01:48:50.349 --> 01:48:51.849
It's all right.
Shush, my darling, be quiet.

01:48:51.873 --> 01:48:53.570
It's going down.
Just don't hurt her.

01:48:53.744 --> 01:48:55.137
See that, Kira?

01:48:55.311 --> 01:48:57.269
Your father knows me.

01:48:57.443 --> 01:49:00.490
He knows I'm prepared
to do terrible things

01:49:00.664 --> 01:49:02.057
to get what I want.

01:49:02.884 --> 01:49:05.582
Even to those I care about most.

01:49:07.366 --> 01:49:10.848
In the end, that's all
that separates the beggar...

01:49:23.774 --> 01:49:25.559
Nobody hurts my Bug.

01:49:27.604 --> 01:49:29.171
Simon, get us out of here!

01:49:36.657 --> 01:49:38.049
Sorry, Ed.

01:49:43.098 --> 01:49:44.403
Sorry, Forge!

01:49:59.027 --> 01:50:00.681
What's that one on about? Who knows?

01:50:00.855 --> 01:50:02.508
Twenty thousand
on the Gray Hands!

01:50:08.645 --> 01:50:10.342
I'm sorry I believed him.

01:50:11.779 --> 01:50:13.650
What? What are you
talking about?

01:50:13.824 --> 01:50:16.784
You have nothing
to apologize for.

01:50:16.958 --> 01:50:19.874
I should have done
so many things differently.

01:50:21.179 --> 01:50:24.443
I had a whole apology,
but I sort of gave it to Sofina.

01:50:25.793 --> 01:50:27.838
I love you, Kir.

01:50:28.012 --> 01:50:31.189
And nothing will ever get in
the way of that again, okay?

01:50:31.712 --> 01:50:32.713
Promise.

01:50:38.153 --> 01:50:40.329
I love you too, Dad.

01:50:40.503 --> 01:50:42.940
It's good to have you back, kid.

01:50:43.114 --> 01:50:45.943
Do you know how much loot
is on this ship?

01:50:47.815 --> 01:50:49.227
I'm surprised
the boat can float.

01:50:49.251 --> 01:50:52.384
All right. So, we're gonna
need to lay low.

01:50:53.037 --> 01:50:54.517
What is that?

01:51:07.443 --> 01:51:09.358
It's the Beckoning Death.

01:51:09.532 --> 01:51:11.882
That's why she needed Forge.

01:51:12.056 --> 01:51:14.668
The games brought the city
together for the spell.

01:51:15.581 --> 01:51:17.888
Szass Tam is taking Never winter.

01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:29.421
Well, shit.

01:51:38.517 --> 01:51:40.519
So what do we do
when we get there?

01:51:40.694 --> 01:51:44.045
Working on it. Simon, what did you say
the range was in that portal staff?

01:51:44.219 --> 01:51:46.047
A quarter mile. Why?

01:51:47.178 --> 01:51:49.920
I'm gonna keep that promise
I made to Xenk.

01:51:58.537 --> 01:52:00.670
Whatever that is,
stop it. Now!

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.110
Look! She's Thayan!

01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:10.245
Please! Please stop!

01:52:31.527 --> 01:52:34.486
You there! Harbor master person.
Are you seeing this?

01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:37.228
As Lord of Never winter,
I demand a ship and crew

01:52:37.402 --> 01:52:39.578
to chase down
five people who have...

01:52:46.324 --> 01:52:48.500
What is this? No!

01:52:58.815 --> 01:53:01.035
It's the gift Forge promised!

01:53:20.402 --> 01:53:22.099
No! No! No!

01:53:22.273 --> 01:53:24.798
No, no, no! No! No!

01:53:24.972 --> 01:53:26.800
No!

01:53:28.497 --> 01:53:30.281
That's for you.
Enjoy that.

01:53:31.152 --> 01:53:32.153
All right.

01:53:33.154 --> 01:53:35.069
This isn't over until
we take her out.

01:53:36.026 --> 01:53:38.420
Whatever happens to us,
stay hidden.

01:53:39.073 --> 01:53:40.335
Use your pendant.

01:53:51.172 --> 01:53:53.000
Where do you think she's gone?

01:54:32.691 --> 01:54:33.997
She missed.

01:55:49.159 --> 01:55:50.378
You all right?

01:56:08.222 --> 01:56:09.788
What do we do
when we get to her?

01:56:09.963 --> 01:56:11.181
I got this.

01:57:16.333 --> 01:57:18.596
You know not
the scope of my power!

01:57:35.483 --> 01:57:37.137
Enough!

01:57:40.270 --> 01:57:42.011
It's another Time Stop!

01:57:42.185 --> 01:57:45.232
Simon, can you counter it? I can't.
She's still too strong!

01:57:45.884 --> 01:57:47.147
I'm so sorr...

01:57:51.455 --> 01:57:53.240
For too long

01:57:53.414 --> 01:57:56.721
I endured the arrogance
of Forge Fitzwilliam.

01:57:56.895 --> 01:57:58.767
The false charm.

01:57:58.941 --> 01:58:01.204
The quips.

01:58:01.378 --> 01:58:04.077
And just as I begin
to purge this place

01:58:04.251 --> 01:58:08.385
of its living filth,
you dare interpose.

01:58:12.128 --> 01:58:15.392
Now, as you die,

01:58:15.566 --> 01:58:18.003
rest assured
it will not be the end.

01:58:18.787 --> 01:58:23.357
For you will forever suffer.

01:58:25.663 --> 01:58:29.102
I'm sorry, your breath
just smells like... old clothes.

01:58:29.276 --> 01:58:30.712
It's bad.

01:58:35.543 --> 01:58:36.761
What is this?

01:58:36.935 --> 01:58:39.721
I countered your Time Stop.
I got better.

01:58:39.895 --> 01:58:42.680
We had to distract you
so Kira could slap on that cuff

01:58:42.854 --> 01:58:44.682
and so Doric could do this.

01:58:50.862 --> 01:58:52.516
I think you got her.

01:59:05.094 --> 01:59:07.879
I honestly didn't think
that plan was gonna work.

01:59:08.576 --> 01:59:10.317
You assured us it would.

01:59:10.491 --> 01:59:12.188
Hey, Holga!

01:59:16.105 --> 01:59:18.063
Did we get her? Holga?

01:59:19.021 --> 01:59:21.980
Yeah.
Yeah, we got her.

01:59:22.807 --> 01:59:24.113
Oh, that's... Oh, God.

01:59:24.287 --> 01:59:25.636
That's not a good spot, is it?

01:59:25.810 --> 01:59:27.812
No, it's not... it's not bad.

01:59:28.987 --> 01:59:29.987
Here.

01:59:30.075 --> 01:59:32.121
Simon! Simon, help her.

01:59:33.383 --> 01:59:36.734
It's a Red Wizard's blade.
There's nothing I can do.

01:59:39.346 --> 01:59:41.043
Hey. Hey.

01:59:41.217 --> 01:59:42.934
We're gonna patch you up.
It's not gonna be a problem.

01:59:42.958 --> 01:59:44.133
Please don't go.

01:59:45.090 --> 01:59:46.831
Easy, Bug, easy. Please don't go.

01:59:47.005 --> 01:59:48.224
Don't mourn me.

01:59:48.398 --> 01:59:50.444
No, no, no. No final words.

01:59:50.618 --> 01:59:53.142
No final words. I'm
proud of what I did here.

01:59:53.316 --> 01:59:55.405
I'm dying a hero.

01:59:56.711 --> 01:59:58.321
And you...

02:00:00.367 --> 02:00:01.846
You're a good man.

02:00:02.499 --> 02:00:04.022
A real Harper.

02:00:05.023 --> 02:00:07.200
Shut up. I'm a moron,
you know that.

02:00:07.852 --> 02:00:09.332
Promise me something.

02:00:10.159 --> 02:00:11.595
Yeah, anything.

02:00:11.769 --> 02:00:14.424
That you're gonna take
good care of our girl.

02:00:15.773 --> 02:00:18.211
She's the best thing
you ever did.

02:00:19.995 --> 02:00:21.431
I will.

02:00:50.373 --> 02:00:51.548
No.

02:00:52.854 --> 02:00:54.072
No!

02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:56.901
I need you.

02:00:59.034 --> 02:01:01.515
I need you.

02:01:58.267 --> 02:02:00.617
We can only use it once.

02:02:04.099 --> 02:02:05.143
I know.

02:02:13.804 --> 02:02:14.936
Holga Kilgore.

02:02:31.735 --> 02:02:34.521
Don't tell me
you wasted it on me.

02:02:36.261 --> 02:02:37.785
Why would you do that?

02:03:00.285 --> 02:03:02.853
Szass Tam won't
be happy about this.

02:03:03.027 --> 02:03:04.725
Well, if he comes after us,
we'll be ready.

02:03:04.899 --> 02:03:06.553
We?

02:03:06.727 --> 02:03:08.685
Oh, that's right. You
don't like humans, do you?

02:03:10.992 --> 02:03:12.123
Some are okay.

02:03:13.951 --> 02:03:15.562
What about you? Hmm?

02:03:15.736 --> 02:03:18.608
Going back to the Harpers?
Be with your people?

02:03:20.305 --> 02:03:21.916
I'm with my people.

02:03:24.092 --> 02:03:25.833
So, uh,

02:03:26.007 --> 02:03:30.228
I know my last attempt to court
you was quite bad.

02:03:30.403 --> 02:03:34.102
But I wonder if you'd consider
having another go at it?

02:03:36.713 --> 02:03:37.845
Yeah, all right. Yeah?

02:03:38.019 --> 02:03:39.760
Calm down.Right.

02:03:47.768 --> 02:03:50.161
Damn! Bloody chalice.

02:04:08.745 --> 02:04:10.051
Good evening.

02:04:11.574 --> 02:04:13.837
Of course, you know
what happened after that.

02:04:14.011 --> 02:04:15.926
With Sofina's magic expunged,

02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:18.059
Lord Neverember finally came to.

02:04:20.235 --> 02:04:22.237
His first official act
was to award

02:04:22.411 --> 02:04:25.370
the saviors of Never winter
the Medal of Heroism.

02:04:26.415 --> 02:04:28.112
And to the Emerald Enclave,

02:04:28.286 --> 02:04:31.768
he granted formal protection
of their people and their land.

02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:41.212
One could argue that my actions,
reprehensible though they were,

02:04:41.386 --> 02:04:43.998
led to a virtual renaissance
for the city.

02:04:44.172 --> 02:04:47.567
And while I've only served the first
year of my sentence, I have to say,

02:04:47.741 --> 02:04:49.003
it has been

02:04:50.134 --> 02:04:51.484
eye-opening.

02:04:52.572 --> 02:04:55.052
I have taken a look inside

02:04:55.749 --> 02:04:57.402
and I've asked myself,

02:04:58.447 --> 02:04:59.840
'What's going on in there?'

02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:06.411
And, you know, I realized
a lot of it goes back to my mum.

02:05:07.674 --> 02:05:10.241
She was a stern woman,
prone to fits of...

02:05:10.415 --> 02:05:12.505
Stop, stop!
We've heard enough.

02:05:14.245 --> 02:05:16.117
Pardon denied.

02:05:16.291 --> 02:05:18.728
This session is adjourned.

02:05:23.646 --> 02:05:24.647
Jarnathan!

02:05:30.261 --> 02:05:32.394
No, no! I'm terribly sorry.

02:05:32.568 --> 02:05:35.484
I don't know what came over me,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

02:07:47.311 --> 02:07:48.486
Hello?

02:07:50.097 --> 02:07:53.143
Can somebody please
ask me another question?

02:07:54.579 --> 02:07:55.624
Anyone?
