1
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:04,629
It's them!

2
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,155
Get ready.

3
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:11,071
Two more prisoners coming in!

4
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:14,204
Prepare for docking!

5
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,859
In position!

6
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,210
Easy!

7
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,742
Gate secure!

8
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,154
Prisoner walking!

9
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,965
Oh, great.
Another cellmate.

10
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,533
No offense, pal.
You seem lovely.

11
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:26,668
Uh... Let's show you around.
Get you situated here.

12
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:31,238
This is the bucket where
our pee freezes. And, um...

13
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,064
Yeah, that's it.

14
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,850
What's your name, lass?

15
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,679
Uh, That's Holga.
I'm Edgin. And you are?

16
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:42,640
I've been in a lot of cells.
Never shared one with a female.

17
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,120
Think I'm gonna like it.

18
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,296
Word of advice,

19
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,970
Holga doesn't love to be disturbed
while she's eating her potatoes.

20
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,519
Kind of the highlight
of her day. Shut up, you!

21
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:53,651
Sure thing. Have at it.

22
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,350
Little shy, eh?

23
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,701
I'm not so bad once
you get to know me.

24
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,137
Mmm.

25
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,574
Don't be like that.

26
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,012
We could be very happy to...

27
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,370
I think I'm gonna do this without
fingers and make it a mitten.

28
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,807
Who am I trying to impress?

29
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,735
Oi! Stop that singing!

30
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:35,911
You got it, Tobias.

31
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,436
The Absolution Council
is tomorrow.

32
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:41,786
Don't get your hopes up, Ed.

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,614
What are you talking about?

34
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,661
Jarnathan is on the council
this time. He's an Aarakocra.

35
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,750
If anyone's gonna free us,
it's him.

36
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,404
Not gonna happen.

37
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:54,364
I tell you, Holga, this is
your last day chopping ice.

38
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,762
By authority
of the Lords' Alliance,

39
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:04,505
this Absolution Council
will now come to order

40
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:09,684
in the case of Edgin Darvis
and Holga Kilgore.

41
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:14,254
This is the second year of
incarceration for the crimes

42
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:17,866
of grand larceny
and skullduggery.

43
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,175
It is the task of this council to
determine your eligibility for pardon.

44
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,047
What say you?

45
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:28,529
Thank you, Chancellor Anderton,
esteemed members of the council.

46
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:34,404
Before I begin, I notice that
Chancellor Jarnathan is not present.

47
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:36,188
Should we perhaps wait?

48
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:39,627
Chancellor Jarnathan was delayed
by the storm. You may begin.

49
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,368
I see. It's just that I...

50
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,849
We were really counting
on him to attend.

51
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:47,199
Begin or waive your statement.

52
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,853
Very well.

53
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,510
I should start
by giving you some context.

54
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,079
You may be surprised to learn
I wasn't always a thief.

55
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:01,126
Years ago, I became a member
of the Harpers faction,

56
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,129
a network of spies who
swear an oath to fight tyranny,

57
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,655
defend the oppressed
and to ask nothing in return.

58
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,659
My wife, Zia, supported my decision,
even though she knew the risks.

59
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,533
By day,
I'd eavesdrop on mercenaries,

60
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,058
stop bandits in their tracks...

61
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,803
and even bring
Thayan Red Wizards to justice.

62
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:33,333
By night, I'd come home to my
loving wife, and daughter, Kira.

63
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,988
To be honest, there were times
when I began to question

64
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:40,601
the 'asking nothing in return'
part of my oath.

65
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,733
But my wife would always say,

66
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:45,649
'You don't have to give us everything,
you only have to give us you.'

67
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:47,061
So what's the latest
on Jarnathan?

68
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:49,000
Is he close by?
Because I can wait.

69
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,263
Did you not hear what we said?
Right, the storm.

70
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,614
It's just that based on
what I know about Jarnathan,

71
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,790
I think he'd be especially
receptive to my story.

72
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,966
And I'd hate to have to wait
a whole other year

73
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,229
to come back in here
and... Proceed.

74
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,013
Absolutely. Here we go.

75
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,581
When you're a Harper,
you're bound to make enemies.

76
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,064
And sometimes those enemies
come looking for revenge.

77
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,900
No cleric can repair the damage
from a Red Wizard's blade.

78
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,946
There was no way to revive her.

79
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:10,038
When Zia died,
so did my devotion to my oath.

80
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,147
I'm sorry, it's just hard
to relive this...

81
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,194
- without Jarnathan here.
- Again with this?

82
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,521
But he missed the most
important part of my back story!

83
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,677
How can he judge me
without knowing my motivation?

84
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:44,376
We are entirely capable of deciding
your case without Jarnathan.

85
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,205
- Get on with it!
- Fine. Where was I? Uh...

86
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,731
By night, I'd come home to my
loving wife, and daughter Kira.

87
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,559
You went back too far.
Stop stalling!

88
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,213
Right, sorry.
Yeah, broad strokes.

89
00:07:55,387 --> 00:08:00,218
The next few months
were among my most shameful.

90
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,309
That's when I met Holga.

91
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,224
She took pity on me.

92
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,967
Well, she took pity on the baby.

93
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:12,709
Holga was a fellow resident
of rock bottom.

94
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,583
Many years before, she'd
been cast out of her tribe

95
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:18,410
for falling in love
with an outsider.

96
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:25,461
We quickly became like
brother and sister.

97
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:29,073
With a relationship built
on trust and mutual respect.

98
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,079
Neither of us had money
or an honest way to earn it,

99
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:39,127
so we decided to table 'honest'
and we tried something new.

100
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,522
It's intoxicating
when you realize

101
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:46,134
that what separates you
from what you've always wanted

102
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:49,224
can be as thin
as a pane of glass.

103
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:06,284
You may be wondering how we could
carry on this criminal lifestyle

104
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,721
with a young girl at home.

105
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,593
Well, we didn't
leave her at home.

106
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,857
Hurry, hurry!
Run, run, run!

107
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,599
Kira wasn't
the only new recruit.

108
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:19,341
We also added Simon,
a so-so sorcerer,

109
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:23,563
and a con man named Forge, who
pushed us to aim even higher.

110
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:30,004
Before long, we became a team.

111
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:32,659
Yes, we were thieves,

112
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,183
but I tried to hold us
to a certain standard.

113
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,924
We never harmed anyone.

114
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:40,057
And we only robbed from those
who would feel it the least.

115
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:45,802
But everything changed
when we met the wizard Sofina.

116
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,631
We knew almost nothing
about her.

117
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,895
Only that she wanted our help
in robbing Korinn's Keep.

118
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,724
That's a Harper stronghold.
I don't know if you've heard of it.

119
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:57,031
I'm sure Jarnathan has.

120
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:00,251
The keep was filled with the priceless
relics seized from evildoers,

121
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,993
and only Harpers could
gain access to the vault.

122
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,300
Which is why Sofina came to us.

123
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:08,651
At first, I refused.
I wouldn't stoop that low.

124
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,611
But then Forge told me that among
the relics in Korinn's Keep,

125
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,917
there was
a Tablet of Reawakening,

126
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:17,312
capable of bringing back
a single deceased person.

127
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:20,054
Even one killed
by a Red Wizard's blade.

128
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,360
You can probably see
where this is going.

129
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,886
Why can't I come? Sorry, Kir,
this one's too dangerous.

130
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,844
Then you shouldn't go.

131
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,325
We have everything that we need.

132
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,415
Not yet.
But this is the last one.

133
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,635
Trust me.

134
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:42,467
Chin up, Bug.
We'll be right back.

135
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,322
I didn't tell her
about the tablet.

136
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,186
It would break her heart
if it all went to shit.

137
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,821
And, well,

138
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,953
to shit it went.

139
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,724
See you soon, love.

140
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,129
Intruders!

141
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:36,825
There they are!

142
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,964
We don't hurt anyone.

143
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,678
She's caught in the Time Stop!
Counter it, Simon!

144
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:04,680
I can't.
Sofina's too powerful.

145
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,737
Take the tablet.
Keep Kira safe.

146
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,873
You have my word.

147
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:38,061
The truth is, even if this council were
to sentence me to another two years,

148
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,716
or 20 for that matter,

149
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,721
it would never be punishment enough
for the worst crime I ever committed...

150
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,899
robbing my daughter
of her father.

151
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:53,685
But know that,
if you do choose to free me,

152
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,950
I'll spend the rest of my days
trying to right that wrong.

153
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,953
Anything you want to add?

154
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,432
I'm good.

155
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,788
Before you announce
your decision,

156
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:11,834
I implore you
to please wait for...

157
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,664
Jarnathan! Pardon my belatedness.

158
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,362
I can't tell you how happy
I am to see you! Step away!

159
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:21,104
Holga, now! Guards!

160
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:23,106
Release me, sir!

161
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,282
She's throwing potatoes!

162
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,328
Oh, Jarnathan!

163
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,853
But we approved your pardon!

164
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,738
Fly, bird, fly!

165
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,807
He's still breathing.

166
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,464
I told you he'd get us out!

167
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,053
Any sign of Kira?

168
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,491
Been empty for a while.

169
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,422
Where do you think
Forge took her?

170
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,773
I can't see him leaving the Sword Coast.
Forge always liked cities.

171
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,299
Some supper
for you and your wife?

172
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,866
What? No.
She's not my wife. Me with that?

173
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,869
With those lips? That's so gross.
Just the drinks.

174
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,049
So, we take a boat
down to Baldur's Gate

175
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,094
and then head north.

176
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:08,706
And while we're looking for
Forge, I'll pay Marlamin a visit.

177
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,350
You sure you really want
to put yourself through that?

178
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:15,887
What if he doesn't want to talk to you?
It's not about what he wants.

179
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,802
Okay. It's about closure.

180
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,327
He sent you a letter saying
he wasn't your husband anymore.

181
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,503
Wasn't that closure?

182
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,244
You wouldn't understand. I don't.

183
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,376
I clearly, clearly don't.

184
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,904
Is that...

185
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,820
Son of a bitch.

186
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,910
Forge is Lord of Never winter.

187
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,870
How did that clown
pull that off?

188
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,133
Well, as long as he's got Kira,
I don't care.

189
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,092
Come on. Let's go.

190
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,225
Thanks, pal.
What's wrong with my lips?

191
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,532
They're too big
for your face. What?

192
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:52,866
A lot of people like my lips.

193
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,348
I've never seen
this place so crowded.

194
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,177
Must be coming in
for the High Sun Games.

195
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:31,441
Yeah, my dad took me to the
last one before they were outlawed.

196
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,095
Anyone win?

197
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,445
Well, one contestant made it
to the final round

198
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,144
before a monster ate
his upper body, so...

199
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:40,407
no.

200
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,717
It's nice to see that Forge
hasn't lost his sense of modesty.

201
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,812
How long has it been? Two years.

202
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,945
No, how long have
we been waiting here?

203
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,427
Dad.

204
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:02,603
Holga?

205
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,213
Kira.

206
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,479
Oh!

207
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,308
- I missed you so much.
- Hello, Bug.

208
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:16,747
- Come here.
- Hi.

209
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,314
Oh.

210
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,013
I thought about you every day.

211
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:27,845
I made you these.

212
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,460
- What are they?
- Mittens!

213
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:36,550
Oh. Thanks.

214
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,900
Have you been okay?

215
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,295
Uncle Forge has been
very good to me.

216
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,340
'Uncle' Forge?

217
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,910
Come on.
He wants to see you.

218
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:53,262
I still wear the pendant
you got me, Holga.

219
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:56,874
I use it to sneak around
the castle sometimes.

220
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,531
So strange that you're here.
Hey, Kir, look.

221
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:07,407
I want you to know I am so sorry
for how things turned out.

222
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,626
I took a risk.

223
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,193
And it didn't pay off.

224
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,195
Why do you look mad at me?

225
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,330
Because you're acting like
it wasn't your fault.

226
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,549
There they are!

227
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,596
Oh!

228
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,293
Old friends.

229
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:27,122
What a wonderful surprise. Come.

230
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:31,996
Oh?

231
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,043
Do I spy a little bit of gray?

232
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,392
I do. I like it.

233
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,829
It's scoundrelly
but professorial.

234
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,571
You look like a...
What do you look like?

235
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,748
You look like a well-read
fisherman with secrets.

236
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,099
And Holga.

237
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,059
I know you don't like hugs.

238
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,887
But I need one. Yes?

239
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,020
- Oh.
- Mmm. Mmm.

240
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,805
Mmm! Mmm.

241
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,373
These last years
must have been dreadful,

242
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,027
but I tell you what,
I did think you'd serve longer.

243
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,858
Oh! Uh, we... We got an...
early release.

244
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,817
Good behavior. Yeah, behaving good.

245
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,819
Ah. I see.

246
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,213
Well, welcome. Welcome back.

247
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:17,520
Oh, that's blistering.
That's blisteringly hot.

248
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:19,087
Yet again.

249
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,568
Kira, we really should speak
to the kitchen staff,

250
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,092
because there's simply no need
for it to be this hot.

251
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:28,096
Yeah, yeah, the tea's hot. So, how
are you the Lord of Never winter?

252
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:33,623
Right. Before you went off to prison,
you charged me with Kira's well-being.

253
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,234
Didn't think much of it
at the time.

254
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,280
But there came a moment
when I looked into her eyes,

255
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,935
and I suddenly knew
I had to be a better man.

256
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,807
Obviously, I couldn't give back
the treasures we'd stolen,

257
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:45,766
so when Lord Neverember
fell ill,

258
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,770
I seized the chance to try and,
you know, make a difference.

259
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:52,314
And the money from Korinn's Keep
paved the way for my campaign.

260
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,165
But I will tell you this...

261
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,231
Couldn't have done it alone.

262
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,474
Ah! And here she is!

263
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,607
You remember Sofina.

264
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,349
You're still working with her?
She's the one that got us caught.

265
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:06,787
Not true, no. Without her,
we all would have been caught.

266
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:08,832
And since then,
she has become...

267
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:12,314
my top adviser. Mmm.

268
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,884
The tea is scorching, I do apologize.
It's scorching hot.

269
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,234
Um, Sofina.

270
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,672
Would you mind very much, um...

271
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,587
Certainly.

272
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:29,939
Hmm.

273
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,291
Good. Thank you. I... I'm...

274
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:36,033
I didn't realize you were gonna
put your finger in the cup, so...

275
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,949
I'm gonna leave that for later.

276
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:42,518
Well, if you'll give us the tablet,
Kira, Holga and I will be on our way.

277
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:45,782
Of course that's why
you came back.

278
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,219
No, it wasn't for me. It was
for that Tablet of Riches.

279
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,830
Riches?

280
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:53,268
No, it 's... it's
the Tablet of Reawakening.

281
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:54,522
I'm sorry, what's this now?

282
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,141
The reason why
I agreed to the heist.

283
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,014
Is that what he's told you?
That I left you for more riches?

284
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:02,669
I told her the truth.
She has a right to know it.

285
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,846
He's been lying to you, Kira.

286
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,979
I wanted to... I wanted
to bring your mother back.

287
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:11,895
Oh, Ed, come on. Look, I know how
much you crave her forgiveness,

288
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,810
but I promise you,
more lies is not the way.

289
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,638
You snake!

290
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,075
You know damn well
what he was after.

291
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,861
Why wouldn't you tell me
if you were doing it for Mom?

292
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:23,820
Because I didn't want you
to lose her again if I failed.

293
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:26,606
But you can't blame the poor
girl for distrusting you.

294
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:28,216
After all,

295
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:33,308
you have been lying since you set
foot in the room, haven't you?

296
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:41,142
- You escaped?
- We were trying to get back to you, Bug.

297
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:42,622
Kira, look at me.

298
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,712
I swear to you, it was
a Tablet of Reawakening.

299
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:48,671
I was doing it for Mom, for all of us.
You have to trust me.

300
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:51,848
You told me to trust you
when you left me.

301
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,940
Kira, no, wait, wait!
Kira!

302
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:58,554
Give her time,
give her time.

303
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:01,510
She's had years to resent you
for your absence.

304
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:04,121
And you've had years
to poison her against me.

305
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:05,601
No, that is not true.

306
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,212
We very rarely
spoke of you at all.

307
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,302
Give him what he came for. The tablet?

308
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,740
I don't think
I will be returning it.

309
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,960
Or your daughter,
for that matter.

310
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,397
You bastard!

311
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:27,144
And now you're in the floor!

312
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:29,495
Oh, I hate to see that.

313
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:33,281
Sofina really is a very,
very powerful wizard!

314
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:37,241
You'd have thought that you'd have learned
that the last time she trapped you.

315
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,549
You always wanted us
to get caught.

316
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:44,771
No, I wanted you and Simon to get
caught, but he managed to escape somehow.

317
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:48,644
All these years together, and you
double-cross us for this witch?

318
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:51,038
Never put your trust
in a con man.

319
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,213
Save for this...

320
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,171
Kira really is happy

321
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,695
and very well
taken care of here,

322
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,698
and I have truly come
to love her as my own.

323
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:03,006
I never actually saw the appeal of
being a father till I became one.

324
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,706
But to have another person
look up to you

325
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,665
and allow you to shape them
in your own image.

326
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,711
It's a bit like a god!

327
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:16,193
Well, hang on, I'm a god and a lord.
I am really doing all right!

328
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:17,673
Black wood?

329
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,197
Could you possibly
return them to prison?

330
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,069
And be sure
to collect the bounty.

331
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:24,332
Well, I must away.

332
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,727
I am expecting two of the wealthiest
men from Baldur's Gate and Water deep

333
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,991
to talk about the High
Sun Games, which are back!

334
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:32,906
So there's something, isn't it?

335
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,430
It was genuinely lovely
to see you both.

336
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,825
Ah! Ah!

337
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,609
Holga! Holga! Holga!

338
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,092
Kill both of them.

339
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:53,796
We got to get her out
of there. We will.

340
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,320
But we need to think
of our own hides right now.

341
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,280
- Yeah, you got this, right?
- I know you don't.

342
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:01,021
On your knees.

343
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,201
Handsome blade.

344
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:10,204
Is that the work
of Ghelryn Foehammer?

345
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,031
How did you know?

346
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,773
The inlay on the haft.

347
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,645
Oh.

348
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,778
How's the weight? Does it parry?

349
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,128
It's dark steel.

350
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,477
Mmm. Very nice.

351
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,000
Now put your heads down.

352
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:27,090
Wait!

353
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,744
What do you clean it with?

354
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,965
You're about to lose your head.

355
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,836
This is what
you're concerned with?

356
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,535
If you wouldn't mind.

357
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:41,757
Boiled linseed oil.
Once a month.

358
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,934
Should be once a week. That's why
you're getting rust on the bit.

359
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,764
Okay, chop it off. Chop
it off, let's do it.

360
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,165
Get her!

361
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,135
Stop her!

362
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:18,359
Oh, we got 'em now!

363
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,519
- Before we leave the city...
- Get boiled linseed oil, I know.

364
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,615
Knock, knock.

365
00:26:57,964 --> 00:27:00,357
I wanted to make sure
you were all right.

366
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,711
I knew I'd see him again
one day.

367
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,758
I just hoped
it would be different.

368
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,500
Well, you have
to understand that

369
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,416
when he lost your mother,

370
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,897
he sort of lost himself.

371
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,989
Why did he lie about the tablet?

372
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:27,994
Maybe he was ashamed to admit how
much he'd given up for so little.

373
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:33,086
I should probably go
speak to him.

374
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,438
What?

375
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,745
Well, he's gone, my dear.
He's gone.

376
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,443
I gave him
the Tablet of Riches and...

377
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,098
he left.

378
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,930
Holga, too?

379
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,194
I'm sorry.

380
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,939
And I want you to know that
even if he isn't there for you,

381
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:02,071
I always will be.

382
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,857
I know.

383
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:08,208
The fact that
you see good in me,

384
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:11,124
makes me believe that there
might just be some in there.

385
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,519
We could shoot an arrow
with a message into her room.

386
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,480
What if it hits her? That
's a risk we're gonna have to take.

387
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:23,005
Killing my daughter with
an arrow? No, it's not.

388
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,226
Even if she got the message, she
wouldn't come. She thinks of...

389
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:28,794
Forge as her dad.

390
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:33,059
We have to get into that castle
and take her out ourselves.

391
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,539
That's crazy, Ed.

392
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,431
Castle Never's tighter than Korinn's Keep,
and you know what happened with that.

393
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,457
We're gonna need a team.

394
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,372
Team?
Who's gonna help us out?

395
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:45,941
We have nothing
to pay them with. Yeah, but Forge does.

396
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:48,615
He said the richest people were
coming to bet on the High Sun Games.

397
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,251
There'll be a fortune
in that vault.Yeah.

398
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,383
Not to mention the tablet.

399
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:54,820
And then Kira will know that...

400
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,474
We abandoned her
for the right reason.

401
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:02,610
I wouldn't put it like that,
but, uh, yeah. Yeah.

402
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,004
Who do we get for this team?

403
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:07,310
You know, I wonder
if Simon's still in Triboar.

404
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,617
Simon's a terrible sorcerer.

405
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,446
We haven't seen him in two years.
I'm sure he's gotten better.

406
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:17,103
No one can hold a candle
to this trick.

407
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:24,414
How about this one? You people
like the smell of fresh-cut grass?

408
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,160
Smell that?
It's fresh-cut grass.

409
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,728
My five-year-old can
do that magic.

410
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,774
But can he do this?

411
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,300
Boo.

412
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:42,171
He hasn't gotten better.

413
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:44,347
I don't think it's about
what he's doing up there.

414
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,481
This is quite hard to be
slightly blurry like this, you know.

415
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,092
Anyone can be very blurry,
but to be slightly blurry,

416
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,790
that's the real magic.

417
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,140
Is that...

418
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,624
What? What was...

419
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,192
Hey!

420
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:05,238
He's nickin' our bits and bobs!

421
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,457
It's not what you think.
It's all part of the act.

422
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:08,763
He's lying.

423
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,286
Get him!

424
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:16,640
Shield spell!

425
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,164
Shield spell!

426
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,348
That wasn't a shield spell.

427
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,931
I am not loving this show.

428
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:50,936
You're a dead man!

429
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,652
- Simon?
- Holga!

430
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:14,133
- Staying for an encore?
- Get me out of here.

431
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,929
I could've warned you
Forge was a prick.

432
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:30,279
Soon as we left that vault,
Sofina tried to kill me

433
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,107
and he just stood by.

434
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,562
You know, there's rumors she
made Lord Neverember fall ill

435
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,111
to clear the way for Forge.

436
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:37,983
Her magic is
on a whole other level.

437
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,637
Don't sell yourself short.
We saw your show.

438
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,292
Yeah, you can hit her with
that fresh-cut grass trick.

439
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:44,946
That's funny.

440
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,122
Look, I don't blame you
for wanting to save Kira,

441
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:50,038
and I love the idea of
knocking Forge off his perch,

442
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:52,127
but robbing Castle Never
isn't worth the risk.

443
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,955
And robbing your audience is?

444
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,264
How broke are you? Desperately.

445
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,614
I was planning on sleeping
in the theater tonight,

446
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:03,051
but now that seems imprudent. So?

447
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:06,141
Do we even know what sort of arcane
magic is protecting the vault?

448
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:07,708
We're gonna find out! How?

449
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,971
You gonna sneak past
the entire Castle Watch?

450
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:13,105
Me? No.
A druid maybe, a Wild Shape.

451
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,846
They could get in and out
undetected as a...

452
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:18,675
As a mouse or a... A deer.

453
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,809
Yes, a deer! It'll blend in with
all the other deer in the castle.

454
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,028
Don't mock me.

455
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,291
Where can we find a druid?

456
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,642
I know a druid. Doric.

457
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,861
She's truly one of a kind.

458
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,299
Sounds romantic in nature.

459
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,431
Yeah. For me it was.

460
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:39,696
She, however, found my lack
of self-esteem unattractive.

461
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,394
Not your best trait.

462
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:42,743
Thank you.

463
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,922
In the name
of Forge Fitzwilliam,

464
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:52,796
the prisoner is hereby sentenced
to death by dismemberment,

465
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,887
for the crime of speaking ill
of our leader.

466
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,673
The Emerald Enclave
will never relent!

467
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,588
Justice cannot be killed!

468
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,372
On my command.

469
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,437
Your Doric's a bit of a
radical. Ready?

470
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:06,593
Oh, no, that's not Doric.

471
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,726
Move in!

472
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,989
Kill her!

473
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,041
Move in!

474
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:22,696
Move in!

475
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,132
That's her.

476
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:40,018
What is that again? It's an owlbear.

477
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:16,315
- How high is this place?
- It's just up here.

478
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:19,013
Stay where you are! Wait! Wait! It's me!

479
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:21,668
Simon. Simon who?

480
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:22,886
Ouch.

481
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,368
Simon Aumar. Sorcerer.

482
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,414
I courted you.

483
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,851
You said I made you feel sad.

484
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,897
Not from anything I did,
just from who I was.

485
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,421
Oh.

486
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,250
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

487
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,903
What are you doing here?

488
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,297
We need a deer. We don't need a deer.

489
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,386
We're gonna take down
Forge Fitzwilliam.

490
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,220
So, how'd you come to live here?

491
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:55,702
I was born to humans who decided
they didn't want a tie fling child.

492
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:58,139
Uh-huh. The wood elves took me in.

493
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,141
I joined the Emerald Enclave
to protect them.

494
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:01,882
That's all the more reason
to join us.

495
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:04,493
You're the only one who can
get into that castle unseen

496
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,191
and tell us what
we're dealing with.

497
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,889
As you can imagine,
I don't trust humans.

498
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:11,457
I find you to be
hateful and selfish.

499
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,503
Well, I'm finding you to be
a little mean.

500
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,505
If it helps,
I'm only half-human.

501
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,941
But you're a bad sorcerer.

502
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,292
No, Simon...
He's a mighty sorcerer!

503
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:23,077
He's a descendant
of Elminster Aumar.

504
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:27,212
The only way to succeed in this is to
have confidence that it can be done.

505
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,649
He doesn't.Yeah, I suppose that's fair.

506
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:33,914
Look, Simon may not have my wit
or Holga's strength,

507
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,177
but when it counts,
this young man delivers.

508
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:39,180
It's why I chose him. He's
also the only sorcerer you know.

509
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:40,703
Holga, not helpful.

510
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:43,402
What is it exactly
that you bring to this?

511
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:48,015
Me? I'm a planner. You know?
I make plans.

512
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,236
You've already made the plan,
so what value do you have now?

513
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:56,937
If, uh, the plan fails... the
existing plan... I make a new plan.

514
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:58,460
So you make plans that fail.

515
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,070
No.He also plays the lute.

516
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:03,117
Holga, not relevant.
Trust me, I'm indispensable.

517
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:08,557
Well,

518
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:11,908
none of the plans we've tried
to take down Forge have worked.

519
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,782
We dared to question
how he came to power,

520
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,697
so he declared us enemies.

521
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,570
Began destroying our homes

522
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,920
and executing our people.

523
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,533
If we don't stop Forge soon,

524
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,231
there'll be nothing left
to defend.

525
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,149
I'm not doing this
for the money.

526
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:39,806
I'm doing this for the people who
took me in when no one else would.

527
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,678
So we'll keep your share then.

528
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:50,556
I sense your impatience.

529
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:53,472
Szass Tam.

530
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:58,694
But you have always been
the disciple I rely on most.

531
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,394
Doff your cowl.

532
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,526
You needn't hide your sigils
from me.

533
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,139
I'd rather be flensed and flayed

534
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:12,186
than spend another hour
with Forge Fitzwilliam.

535
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,233
The man is insufferable.

536
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:21,369
But we never would have come
this far without his 'charm.'

537
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:26,156
The living have befouled
this world long enough.

538
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:31,684
Take solace in knowing that your
work here is nearly complete.

539
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:35,557
There you are!

540
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,431
With your hood off, I notice.

541
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,521
Probably best to keep that on.

542
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:45,045
You know,
you Red Wizards of Thay

543
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:48,353
are not as popular as you
should be outside Thay.

544
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:52,270
And, of course, you're about
to be considerably less popular.

545
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:58,580
But far, far be it from me ever
to tell you what to do.

546
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:00,365
Caldwell and Piradost
have arrived.

547
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,932
I was gonna give them...

548
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:05,935
Awful, isn't it? I really have to
do something about these chairs.

549
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,633
They're, uh...

550
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,594
Now, I think you will find that we
have taken every imaginable measure

551
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:15,031
to protect the assets
that you may... or may not...

552
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,730
Choose to wager
during the High Sun Games.

553
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:21,124
We have new portcullises
on every wing of the castle.

554
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,865
If the alarm is raised,

555
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,216
nobody gets in or out.

556
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,743
And then there is...

557
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,875
the vault itself.

558
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:37,532
My chief adviser, Sofina,
can give you all the details.

559
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,799
It is protected by
the Arcane Seal of Mordenkainen.

560
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:51,546
Well, uh...

561
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,376
Perhaps not
all the details, but, uh,

562
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,379
suffice to say it is
a seriously powerful spell.

563
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:01,469
Might I inquire, what prompted
you to resume the games?

564
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:03,906
Lord Neverember considered
them quite brutal.

565
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,126
Lord Neverember and I are
very different men.

566
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,302
For example, I prefer
to be up and about.

567
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,348
He prefers to be
in a vegetative state.

568
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,438
You are terrible.

569
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,354
I can be naughty. No, I...

570
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:19,705
The truth is that the games bring
the city together like nothing else.

571
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:25,624
And it is not the role of government
to deny the people what they crave.

572
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:29,889
Or to deny you rich bastards
the right to profit off them.

573
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,154
Now who wants refreshments?

574
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:35,634
Silence!

575
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,204
A Wild Shape is among us.

576
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,104
Hey!

577
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,540
Stop!

578
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,419
I can't grab her!

579
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:18,057
So she did become a deer.

580
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:19,885
Only at the very end.

581
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:22,714
Are you absolutely sure
about Sofina? I saw her markings.

582
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:24,846
No wonder I couldn't counter
her Time Stop.

583
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,110
Forge knew all along. He's got my
daughter in there with a Red Wizard.

584
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:32,375
The vault is protected by something
called 'Morty Kamen's Arcane Seal.'

585
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,768
Mordenkainen?

586
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:36,162
Yeah, that's it. Oh, pity.

587
00:42:36,336 --> 00:42:38,338
What? If the vault has
Mordenkainen's Seal,

588
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:40,072
we're not getting in.
It's impenetrable.

589
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:41,733
Can't you just open it
with magic?

590
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:43,778
Okay, here we go.

591
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:47,216
I hate how everyone thinks that you
can solve any problem with magic.

592
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,350
There are limits.
This isn't some bedtime story.

593
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:53,309
This is the real world. So
there's no way to open it?

594
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:57,531
No, I mean, if I were one of the
world's most powerful sorcerers, so, no.

595
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,402
Or if we had
the Helm of Disjunction.

596
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:01,491
The what?

597
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,706
It's a helmet that disables
all nearby enchantments.

598
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:06,496
But it doesn't matter. The thing
went missing ages ago. We're done.

599
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,890
Huh? Come on.

600
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:11,893
What's the problem?
We can find that helmet.

601
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:15,505
Even if we did, I couldn't use it without
attuning to it, which I'm terrible at.

602
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,551
You can do it.
I know you can.

603
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:20,225
You saying that doesn't make it so.
Yeah, but you saying it does.

604
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:21,468
But I can't.But you can.

605
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:22,730
But I won't.Just say it.

606
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:23,992
No! Fine.

607
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,864
Can we just keep this
between us?

608
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:28,867
I don't want to hurt
the group's morale. What morale?

609
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,479
Holga knows where the helmet is. You do?

610
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:35,656
My tribe fought the Cult of the
Dragon over it at the Evermoors.

611
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,615
We could just ask them
where it went.

612
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,965
That battle was a century ago.
They're all dead.

613
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:42,097
So? Ask them with magic.

614
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:44,902
He just made a whole speech how he
can't fix everything with magic.

615
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:46,406
Actually,
that is something I can do.

616
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,148
You can bring back the dead?

617
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,280
I can't, uh, bring them back,

618
00:43:51,454 --> 00:43:54,153
but I have this token that lets
me ask corpses some questions,

619
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:55,807
and then they go back
to being dead.

620
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:58,070
Yuck. Yeah, it's fairly horrible.

621
00:43:58,244 --> 00:44:00,507
It's fairly wonderful.

622
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:04,076
We're off to the Evermoors.
Thank you, Simon, for the drinks.

623
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,599
Oh, what? No...

624
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,732
Just pay it with magic.

625
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:30,537
The Wild Shape must be in
league with Forge's former partners.

626
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:33,148
Perhaps Forge is
working against us?

627
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:35,324
As long as he profits,

628
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:37,892
he will not interfere
with Szass Tam's conquest.

629
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,894
I will find these thieves.

630
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:41,853
Before you go,

631
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:45,073
the men behind us
allowed them to escape.

632
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,901
Understood.

633
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,252
He's a Thayan!

634
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:15,713
Hey, Ed.

635
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:18,585
Huh? Look where we are.

636
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:21,109
Marlamin? Really?

637
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:23,155
Why would you do that
to yourself?

638
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:25,548
I'm just gonna pick up
some of my things.

639
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:32,773
He painted the shutters.

640
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:34,557
Pretty.

641
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:44,045
Holga!

642
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:45,873
Hello, Marlamin.

643
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:48,267
- That's Marlamin?
- Oh, yeah.

644
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:51,531
We were all a little surprised
the first time we met him.

645
00:45:52,488 --> 00:45:54,577
I thought your sentence
was longer.

646
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,275
I busted out of there.

647
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:01,236
Same old Holga.

648
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:05,153
So what have you been up to?

649
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,068
Oh.

650
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:08,678
The usual.

651
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:11,159
I've got my garden.
I'm working on my book.

652
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:14,032
I see you still have that
walking stick I gave you.

653
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:16,643
Yeah. Yeah.

654
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:18,906
Well, you can take it with you
if you want.

655
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,952
Gwinn's not much for rambling. Gwinn?

656
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,799
You home, darling? In here.

657
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:26,218
Oh! Squashed a pack
of bullywugs down at the...

658
00:46:26,392 --> 00:46:27,785
Oh. Hello.

659
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:30,309
Who's this, then? Oh, Gwinn, this is Holga.

660
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:32,224
Oh.

661
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,139
Heard a lot about you.

662
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,097
I'd shake your hand,
but, uh...

663
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:37,271
Pleasure.

664
00:46:37,316 --> 00:46:39,057
How long you in town for?

665
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:40,667
Um, just passing through.

666
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,148
Gonna talk to some corpses
south of Nesmé.

667
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:44,802
Oh. Great, yeah.

668
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,067
Gonna get washed up for supper.
What we having?

669
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,286
I cured a goose and I
gathered some pickleberries.

670
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,635
Mmm.

671
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,681
Nice meeting you, Holga.Yeah.

672
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:01,514
So how long have you two...
Going on a year.

673
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,995
Does she make you happy?

674
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:05,692
Happier than I did?

675
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,914
Well, I'll put it this way:
She makes her living honestly.

676
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:12,568
She doesn't drink herself silly.

677
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,486
And she doesn't make me weep
in the small hours,

678
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,358
wondering where she is.

679
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:21,055
I was in pain.

680
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:23,797
I was banished from my
damn tribe to be with you.

681
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,974
And I tried to build us a home
so you could forget that.

682
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:30,717
But you never could.

683
00:47:34,068 --> 00:47:35,809
Gwinn seems lovely.

684
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,159
You deserve that.

685
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,552
Thank you.

686
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:43,382
You know, when you left,
I lost my family.

687
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:48,039
I've been fortunate enough
to find another.

688
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:52,652
And I wish nothing less
than that for you.

689
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:58,136
My sweet, old Ho-Ho.

690
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,240
We're gonna take down Forge.

691
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:20,245
I'm gonna show Marlamin and the Elk
tribe they were fools to let me go.

692
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:43,154
So many of my kin gave
their lives in battle here.

693
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:48,681
I'd always imagined I'd be buried
in sacred ground like this.

694
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:49,899
Yeah.

695
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:52,293
Anyone got a shovel?

696
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:01,085
Okay, Simon, how does this work?

697
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:04,001
I read the incantation
on this cleric's token.

698
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:05,480
Should be here somewhere.

699
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,613
Here!

700
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:11,182
All right. Once the dead man is
revived, we can ask him five questions,

701
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:14,315
at which point he will die
again, never to be re-revived.

702
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:16,274
Why five questions?

703
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:18,121
I don't know,
that's just how it works. Seems arbitrary.

704
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:20,800
Can we get on with this, please?
Right, yes.

705
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:30,331
Delightful.

706
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,345
Maybe I'm not saying it right.

707
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:50,264
I wasn't scared,
merely startled.

708
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:53,441
Here we go.

709
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:56,923
Were you killed in
the Battle of the Evermoors?

710
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,968
Yes. Great!

711
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:02,842
I mean, not for you.
Sorry for your loss.

712
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:04,800
Four more questions, right?

713
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,106
Yes.

714
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,629
No. No, no,
that wasn't for you.

715
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:08,963
Did that count as a question?

716
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,111
- Yes.
- Damn it.

717
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,680
Only answer when
I talk to you, okay?

718
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:17,509
Yes. Why did you say 'okay?'
at the end of that?

719
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:19,076
I didn't.

720
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:21,861
Fantastic. Where's the shovel?

721
00:51:29,738 --> 00:51:31,000
Toke Horgath.

722
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:35,831
During the battle, did you see
the Helmet of Disjunction?

723
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:40,140
It was in possession of my
chief, Stan hard Grimwulf.

724
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:42,011
Okay, good.

725
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,188
And what did
Stan hard Grimwulf do with it?

726
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:50,629
As the cultists breached the
ridge, we knew we outnumbered them.

727
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:55,416
But our advantage meant nothing
against the dragon Rakor.

728
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,123
Horgath!

729
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:07,994
Horgath!

730
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,084
Take this and run.

731
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:13,869
Keep it from Rakor at all costs!

732
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,654
Understood, sir.
Don't worry.

733
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:18,135
That's the last thing
I remember.

734
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:24,141
Oh. Yeah, well...

735
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,578
Thanks for your help.

736
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:28,928
Let's go look
for Stan hard Grimwulf's grave.

737
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:30,712
Hang on! Hang on! Hmm?

738
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,908
Aren't you going to ask him
the last three questions?

739
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:34,997
Ask him what? He already
told us everything he knows.

740
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:37,581
Well, you can't just leave him like that.
Look at the poor bloke.

741
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,461
Oh, fine.

742
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:42,811
What's your favorite food?

743
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:45,640
Oats. No, barley!

744
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:47,207
Oh, boy.

745
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:49,514
Do you like cats?

746
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:50,950
Not really.

747
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:52,169
Okay.

748
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:53,909
What's two plus two?

749
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,389
I'm bad at math.

750
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:57,348
Don't you feel better? No.

751
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,482
Oftentimes,

752
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:04,050
the most onerous decision
a leader can take

753
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,965
is when to retreat.

754
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:08,663
I issued the order.

755
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:13,625
I commanded my battle lord
to deliver the helmet

756
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:16,062
to our swiftest rider,
Ven Salafin.

757
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:18,369
If we can just make it
over the ridge, we can...

758
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:21,154
Not again.

759
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:25,158
It was the morning
of the battle.

760
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:30,294
As I stepped out my bath,
my foot slipped on the stone.

761
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,169
And then you went into
the battle?

762
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:39,738
No. I died. From the fall.

763
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:42,784
But Stan hard Grimwulf said he
gave the helmet to Ven Salafin.

764
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:44,786
That's you, isn't it?

765
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,137
I'm Sven Salafin.
Ven's my brother.

766
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,575
This is a nightmare.

767
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:52,011
Is Ven all right?

768
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:57,059
I was wounded
and had lost my horse

769
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,844
as I escaped
the field of battle.

770
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:01,412
I didn't care about myself.

771
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:03,805
I just needed
to keep the helmet safe.

772
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:17,254
It was a Thayan,
who bore the mark of Szass Tam.

773
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,389
I waited for the killing blow.

774
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:24,478
But it never came.

775
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,481
He had a kind way.

776
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:30,179
He told me
his name was Xenk Yendar.

777
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:33,487
He had fled Szass Tam
and now lived in exile.

778
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:37,448
As I died, he promised
to keep the helmet safe.

779
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:39,580
And for some reason,
I believed him.

780
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:41,974
You're joking.
A 'kind' Thayan?

781
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:43,148
I speak truth.

782
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:44,672
You speak horseshit.

783
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:47,022
That Thayan lied
and you died for nothing.

784
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:49,996
The helmet's a dead end. We'll have
to find another way into the vault.

785
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,071
No, I've heard of Xenk.

786
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:54,615
He's a paladin. He helped the
Enclave defeat the Clerics of Talos.

787
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:55,814
I know the name as well.

788
00:54:55,988 --> 00:54:57,548
My uncle said Xenk
fended off a Beholder

789
00:54:57,642 --> 00:54:59,165
using only a sharpened gourd.

790
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,994
A sharpened gourd? Something sharp.

791
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:05,345
The Thayans are murderers.
End of story.

792
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:08,348
What?

793
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,437
I've heard of him, too.No.

794
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:13,310
He fought with my cousin in the Anauroch.
He says he's a good man.

795
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:17,226
Well, you can all go find this lovely
Xenk and braid each other's hair.

796
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:18,750
I'll find another way.

797
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,929
What's his problem? He's got a history
with the Thayans.

798
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:28,325
I know how you're feeling.
But we're running out of time.

799
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,764
I'd be betraying Zia.

800
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:36,507
No, you wouldn't. You'd be
doing it to save her and Kira.

801
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:39,161
Look, if Xenk turns out
to be a prick,

802
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,207
I'll split him
right down the middle.

803
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,645
That's very sweet. What
have we got to lose?

804
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:50,521
Anyone know where
stupid Xenk is?

805
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,480
Last I heard, he was working with
the Harpers in Mornbryn's Shield.

806
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,482
Great! Harpers.

807
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,310
What's his problem with Harpers?

808
00:55:57,484 --> 00:55:59,007
He's got a history
with them too.

809
00:55:59,181 --> 00:56:00,531
All right, let's go.

810
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:02,663
Excuse me?

811
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:05,405
I'm still alive.

812
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,189
Right. Um...

813
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:10,192
What's your favorite book?

814
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,194
Mmm, hard to pick just one.

815
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:14,545
Fifth question, right? Yep.

816
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,677
Good. In terms of historical works,

817
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:20,638
I'd say The Fanged Tome
of Lykanthus Szar.

818
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:24,250
That was only
the fourth question.

819
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:26,078
Hello?

820
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:28,689
Oh, shit.

821
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:33,346
Heave! Heave!

822
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,130
Come on,
we need more! Come on!

823
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,905
It's alive!

824
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,213
Thank you!

825
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:16,258
Thank you, sir.

826
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:29,402
He's interesting. I' ve
seen more interesting.

827
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:31,448
Ed, go talk to him. You go talk to him.

828
00:57:31,622 --> 00:57:33,382
You know,
I've pulled cats out of fish.

829
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,111
Xenk, is it?

830
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,550
That is a query
I prefer not to answer

831
00:57:46,593 --> 00:57:48,247
without knowing
to whom I am speaking.

832
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:49,901
I'm Holga Kilgore.

833
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:53,165
This is Simon, Edgin
and Doric back there.

834
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:57,386
And what brings you
to Mornbryn's Shield? You do.

835
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,693
We're trying to find
the Helmet of Dysfunction.

836
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:01,478
Disjunction.

837
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:03,480
Many lives were lost
in defense of that helm.

838
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:06,047
To speak of it would be
to diminish their sacrifice.

839
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:11,139
Janklee.

840
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:14,752
Jankleeto you as well, good sir.

841
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:21,846
You're known as a man
of honor and integrity,

842
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:26,154
and I can assure you, our reasons for
wanting the helmet are entirely noble.

843
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:27,808
Yep.
We're gonna rob someone.

844
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,375
Holga!

845
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:32,117
Not just anyone.
Forge Fitzwilliam.

846
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,380
And the Red Wizard of Thay
he's partnered with.

847
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:37,601
Come with me.

848
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:43,781
What is this place?

849
00:58:43,955 --> 00:58:46,348
A Harper sanctuary.

850
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,655
But surely your friend Edgin
already knew that.

851
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:51,702
How'd you know I was a Harper?

852
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:54,226
You may have forsworn your oath,

853
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,577
but your oath
hasn't forsworn you.

854
00:58:57,751 --> 00:59:01,755
Just because that sentence is
symmetrical doesn't make it not nonsense.

855
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:03,757
Why do you wish
to rob Fitzwilliam?

856
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:06,586
He stole Edgin's daughter and a
great deal of treasure from us.

857
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,066
Also a Tablet of Reawakening.

858
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,894
He doesn't need to know
all that.

859
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:11,417
I was just...

860
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,462
In other words,
Forge is a real son of a bitch.

861
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,639
So you blame his mother
for his corruption.

862
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,075
What?

863
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:18,772
No, it's an expression.

864
00:59:18,946 --> 00:59:20,557
I see.

865
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:22,776
I do not traffic
in colloquialisms.

866
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:25,518
You're not a lot of fun,
are you?

867
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,912
If Fitzwilliam is truly
allied with a Red Wizard,

868
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:31,611
their intentions must go
beyond the mere political.

869
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:34,048
Over a century ago,
the necromancer Szass Tam

870
00:59:34,222 --> 00:59:36,877
was one of eight zulkirs
who ruled the nation of Thay.

871
00:59:37,051 --> 00:59:38,313
Great, a history lesson.

872
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:40,577
But Tam's hunger for power
was absolute.

873
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,015
On the eve of the solstice,

874
00:59:44,189 --> 00:59:47,192
residents of the capital gathered
for a celebration.

875
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:56,114
Unbeknownst to them,
or his fellow rulers,

876
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,159
Tam had a plan of his own:

877
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:01,510
To stage an unholy coup.

878
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:30,191
He unleashed
the Beckoning Death,

879
01:00:30,365 --> 01:00:33,891
a spell that would consume the
souls of all who beheld it,

880
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:36,763
enslaving them to his will.

881
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:38,809
With the aid of his Red Wizards,

882
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:41,986
Szass Tam created an army
of the undead,

883
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,337
allowing him to conquer
the entire nation.

884
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:51,822
Szass's power extends no further
than the borders of Thay.

885
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:54,041
I suspect he and his Red Wizards
will not be content

886
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:57,218
until they have infected the whole
of Faerûn with their maleficence.

887
01:00:57,392 --> 01:00:59,917
You done? Because we already
know that Red Wizards are bad.

888
01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:01,658
And so does Forge.

889
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:03,592
The question remains, if they
helped him to take power,

890
01:01:03,616 --> 01:01:04,791
what do they stand to gain?

891
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,880
Sounds like we have
a common enemy.

892
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:08,934
You give us that helmet,
and we take Forge down.

893
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,015
No one stays Lord without
a fortune to back him up.

894
01:01:11,189 --> 01:01:12,886
And the Red Wizards
lose their puppet.

895
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,193
What will become
of the wealth you burgle?

896
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:17,151
What does that matter?

897
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,806
I will not be complicit in the
illicit use of ill-gotten booty.

898
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,158
Uh... Fine. We'll divide it
amongst the townspeople.

899
01:01:24,332 --> 01:01:26,421
Swear to it. What?

900
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:28,380
Place your hand
on this Harper's Seal

901
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:31,688
and swear that you will indeed
distribute all the wealth you take

902
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:33,777
amongst the people
of Never winter.

903
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:36,388
Sure, fine.

904
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:41,610
Go on, Ed.

905
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:44,309
Promise you'll give
Forge's money to the people.

906
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:51,751
Promise I'll...

907
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:54,449
give Forge's money
to the people of Never winter.

908
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:56,147
Keep this.

909
01:01:57,322 --> 01:02:00,804
You may not yet
believe your words, but I do.

910
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,286
Yeah. Good for you.
Simon, hold onto this.

911
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,940
Now, where's the helmet?

912
01:02:07,114 --> 01:02:09,638
In the bowels of the Under dark.
The Under dark?

913
01:02:09,813 --> 01:02:11,878
Weren't you trying to keep it safe?
Why would you put it down there?

914
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:14,742
Because it is the last place that
anyone who values their life would go.

915
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,254
Sounds lovely. Quite the opposite.

916
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:18,952
I-I know. I was being ironic.

917
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:22,826
I find irony is a blade that cuts
he who wields it most especially.

918
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,872
Yeah?
Is that what you find, Xenk?

919
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:28,005
There is an entrance east
of the Sword Mountains

920
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:29,615
in the Kryptgarden Forest,

921
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:32,792
from which we may descend
to the ruins of Dolblunde.

922
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:37,884
If I may be so bold, what caused
you to renounce the Harpers?

923
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:42,976
Being a Harper
got my wife killed.

924
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,283
I'm sorry.

925
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:47,198
Did her assailants find justice?

926
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:48,982
The Thayans, you mean?

927
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:51,550
No.

928
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:53,726
The Thayans
are not all malevolent.

929
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:57,730
I was a boy when Szass Tam
seized control of Thay.

930
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:02,996
I saw firsthand
the horrors of the spell.

931
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:07,087
Honorable men
turned to monsters.

932
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:10,221
Minds wiped clean in moments.

933
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:13,964
Parents
turning on their own child.

934
01:03:34,245 --> 01:03:36,813
I escaped, alive,

935
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:40,207
but forever changed.

936
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:43,994
You and I have both lost
a part of ourselves.

937
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:46,910
All that matters is what
we do with what remains.

938
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:49,434
I told you what I'm gonna do.

939
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:51,848
I'm gonna break into Castle
Never and get my family back.

940
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:53,481
And the tablet?

941
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:55,832
You plan to resurrect
your wife.Yeah.

942
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,096
Very well.

943
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,162
I'd only ask that you consider that this
plane we call 'life' is but one of many.

944
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:03,404
Uh-huh.

945
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:05,537
To drag your lady-love
back to her old life

946
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,321
is to deprive her
of her new one.

947
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:10,150
Can someone else
ride next to this guy?

948
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,509
Follow me to the orifice.

949
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:26,427
The orifice?

950
01:04:28,038 --> 01:04:30,562
The Under dark
has many entrances.

951
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:35,567
This is one of
the less conspicuous.

952
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:44,706
I'll go last.

953
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:49,886
It's a day's trek. I've chosen
a path to avoid the populace.

954
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,453
Stay close and quiet.

955
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:56,675
Whatever you've heard of this place is
merely a fraction of its true danger.

956
01:04:58,242 --> 01:05:00,244
Should the way become too dim,

957
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:03,334
you may take my hand,
and I will lead you.

958
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:08,992
I'll tell you right now,
I'm not taking his hand.

959
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:23,267
Keep your guard up.
I don't trust this guy.

960
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:26,270
Even though he's helping us?

961
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:28,794
Ah, he's got something
up his sleeve.

962
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,188
The only thing up my sleeve
is my arm.

963
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:34,104
How could he hear that?
I hear that as well.

964
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:35,932
I hate you.

965
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,296
The path to the ruins
is just here.

966
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:01,695
Keep still!

967
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:06,614
Rochnon.

968
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:09,617
Intellect devourers.
Small but formidable.

969
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,534
They stun their targets and consume
the brain, taking control of the body.

970
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,667
What do we do? Make no sound.

971
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:18,975
They're drawn to mental energy.

972
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:23,457
The higher the intelligence of the prey,
the more likely they are to strike.

973
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:42,346
Well, that's a little hurtful.

974
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:47,307
There it is.
The Hanging City of Dolblunde.

975
01:06:48,526 --> 01:06:52,356
The helmet lies on the far side
of this chasm.

976
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:56,882
But be warned, the bridge is
protected by an ancient Gnomish trap.

977
01:06:57,056 --> 01:07:00,277
There is a precise formula we must follow
so as not to trigger the mechanism.

978
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,280
What's the formula? It's quite simple.

979
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:05,891
Starting from the center,
use odd-numbered blocks only,

980
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:08,385
moving forward with each step,
except for every fifth step,

981
01:07:08,502 --> 01:07:09,662
which must be a lateral move.

982
01:07:09,808 --> 01:07:11,462
Left or right, it matters not,

983
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,744
so long as the leader and the
laggard remain equidistant.

984
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:16,771
After which, proceed.
Again, odd-numbered blocks only.

985
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:20,036
However, at the midpoint we
switch to even-numbered blocks.

986
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,908
Same pattern, except now a lateral
move after the fourth step,

987
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,258
until we reach the three...

988
01:07:33,527 --> 01:07:35,181
I...

989
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,140
I may have...

990
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:39,446
put my foot on the bridge.

991
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,927
Didn't realize that's where
it technically started.

992
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:47,019
So... sorry.

993
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,071
It's not very
structurally sound.

994
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:59,858
Can't you just magic us across?

995
01:08:00,032 --> 01:08:02,817
It's too far for telekinesis.

996
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:05,603
I've got some rope in my bag.

997
01:08:05,777 --> 01:08:07,344
I could tie it to the axe.

998
01:08:07,518 --> 01:08:09,694
Toss it across
so it sticks to the rock.

999
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:13,263
You know rocks are
hard, right? Shut up.

1000
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:14,742
Where did you get that?

1001
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:17,571
What, Marlamin's walking stick?

1002
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:19,965
I swiped it from a wizard
over in the Grey peaks.

1003
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:21,967
That's not a walking stick.

1004
01:08:23,621 --> 01:08:25,188
It's a Hither-Thither staff.

1005
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:28,191
A what? Should have a range
of around 500 yards.

1006
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:30,802
Watch.

1007
01:08:30,976 --> 01:08:32,108
Hither.

1008
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:34,284
Thither.

1009
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:38,853
It works!

1010
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,553
See?

1011
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:45,643
Didn't even need the bridge!

1012
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:47,862
I did good.

1013
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,213
Good save.

1014
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:35,693
This I give you now, trusting that you
will protect it with your very life.

1015
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:37,521
I will.

1016
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,350
Hold this.

1017
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:46,878
There is evil here.

1018
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:00,108
Are those...

1019
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,241
Thayan assassins.

1020
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:05,505
You look older, Yendar.

1021
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,813
Must be all that
foul mortal blood.

1022
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:13,948
And you, Dralas, look just as
loathsome as the last time we met.

1023
01:10:14,122 --> 01:10:19,302
Then I'll see to it
we don't meet again.

1024
01:10:19,476 --> 01:10:21,478
Leave them to me.

1025
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:56,268
I'm glad he's on our side.

1026
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:01,141
We must flee.

1027
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:02,927
Why? You killed them all.

1028
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:05,712
'Tis no simple feat to kill
that which is already dead.

1029
01:12:10,717 --> 01:12:12,850
Ready for the next bout, Yendar?

1030
01:12:15,156 --> 01:12:16,810
Quickly!

1031
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:06,817
That's one pudgy dragon.

1032
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:10,168
It's Themberchaud.
He must have found a new den.

1033
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:11,822
Did he eat the last one?

1034
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:30,204
I got you!

1035
01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:43,174
It's a dead end!

1036
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:45,829
Simon! Up there!

1037
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:39,230
Thanks for that.

1038
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,972
You'd have done the same for me.

1039
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:44,714
Yeah.

1040
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:48,848
Bastard won't quit!

1041
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:01,644
Come on! He's stuck!

1042
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,080
So are we.

1043
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:12,263
We're gonna drown!

1044
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:15,527
Well, portal us out of here! I can
only portal us to what I can see!

1045
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,381
You want to go from
that wall to that wall?

1046
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,663
It's salt water.

1047
01:16:20,837 --> 01:16:23,579
Simon, you remember that trick
you did in Triboar?

1048
01:16:23,753 --> 01:16:24,753
Fresh-cut grass smell?

1049
01:16:24,884 --> 01:16:27,191
No, the flame finger one.

1050
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:29,106
Yeah, why? Holga, hit him!

1051
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,108
You want to make him angrier?

1052
01:16:31,282 --> 01:16:33,676
When I say so,
everybody goes underwater.

1053
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:36,287
And that'll be your cue, Simon,
all right?

1054
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:38,071
What are you looking at?

1055
01:16:38,245 --> 01:16:41,074
A Harper shaking off
his slumber.

1056
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,599
Go, Holga!

1057
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:49,517
Again!

1058
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:53,738
Now!

1059
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:33,953
This is where I leave you.

1060
01:17:34,127 --> 01:17:36,303
I wish you every success
on your journey.

1061
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:40,438
You're not coming? Would that I could.

1062
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:43,049
But this is your quest.

1063
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:46,574
I have given you the tools.
You must utilize them.

1064
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,402
Can't you utilize them for us?

1065
01:17:48,576 --> 01:17:51,101
Because you're much better
at fighting and strategy and...

1066
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:53,669
Pretty much everything
but talking.

1067
01:17:55,366 --> 01:17:56,497
Talking to you isn't great.

1068
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,760
Mmm.

1069
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:02,765
In those instances where
faith wanes and doubt waxes,

1070
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:04,419
I recall
the Tenets of the Ancients...

1071
01:18:04,592 --> 01:18:06,333
Okay. See you later.

1072
01:18:21,914 --> 01:18:23,263
There he goes.

1073
01:18:25,483 --> 01:18:27,093
Just wandering off.

1074
01:18:28,616 --> 01:18:30,967
Walks in such a straight line.

1075
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:34,057
Uh-oh. Wait a minute.
He's coming up on a rock.

1076
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:36,407
Is he gonna go around?

1077
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:37,843
Nope.

1078
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:39,845
Right over the rock.

1079
01:18:47,113 --> 01:18:48,854
What are you mumbling?

1080
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:51,161
I'm preparing to attune.

1081
01:18:51,335 --> 01:18:53,990
If I can't connect with it,
it'll be useless.

1082
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:58,211
That's a lot of pressure, given
all we went through to get it.

1083
01:18:58,385 --> 01:18:59,952
Yeah, I realize that.

1084
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:04,348
So our entire fate rests on you.

1085
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:07,133
Come on.

1086
01:19:30,113 --> 01:19:33,507
There he is,
the great Simon Aumar.

1087
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:36,597
Sorcerer descended
from wizarding blood.

1088
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,034
Who are you?

1089
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:40,166
Don't you know me?

1090
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,909
My name is Aumar too.

1091
01:19:45,606 --> 01:19:46,999
You're my
great-great grandfather.

1092
01:19:50,568 --> 01:19:52,657
That's quite a helm.

1093
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,616
What makes you think
you're worthy of it?

1094
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,445
I believe in myself?

1095
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:00,056
You're asking me?

1096
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,319
No, I'm... I'm sure.

1097
01:20:02,493 --> 01:20:04,103
I'm a great sorcerer.

1098
01:20:04,277 --> 01:20:05,626
Are you now?

1099
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,673
Funny thing about magic.

1100
01:20:09,717 --> 01:20:12,068
It chooses who may wield it.

1101
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:14,548
And it does not suffer fools.

1102
01:20:14,722 --> 01:20:16,072
Why are you telling me this?

1103
01:20:16,246 --> 01:20:19,336
I think you know, Simon.

1104
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:25,516
Did you attune with it?

1105
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:26,996
You okay?

1106
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:28,649
I got you.

1107
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:31,478
What happened?

1108
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:32,871
I, uh...

1109
01:20:33,045 --> 01:20:35,134
- I spoke to someone.
- Yeah?

1110
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:37,180
My great-great grandfather.
He was...

1111
01:20:38,224 --> 01:20:38,964
unhelpful.

1112
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:41,097
You spoke to him?

1113
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:43,989
From here, it looked like the helmet
flew off the second you put it on.

1114
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:45,841
Well, time moves
differently there.

1115
01:20:46,015 --> 01:20:47,843
Okay,
I'll try a different approach.

1116
01:20:48,017 --> 01:20:50,019
Great. New approach. Try it.

1117
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:52,760
You got this.
You got this.

1118
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:01,465
You're getting better.
You didn't fly as far.

1119
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:03,032
Stick with it.

1120
01:21:03,206 --> 01:21:04,923
We have six hours till
we leave for Never winter.

1121
01:21:04,947 --> 01:21:06,818
You fail, I never
get my family back.

1122
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:08,080
Brilliant.

1123
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:29,449
I've never seen a bigger coward.

1124
01:21:29,623 --> 01:21:32,061
Coward?
You're under here, too.

1125
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:33,932
Fine. I'll handle it.

1126
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:35,891
No, no, no.

1127
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,545
I've got this.

1128
01:21:40,852 --> 01:21:43,159
And you want to be a Harper.

1129
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,595
Quiet!

1130
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:51,167
Oh, God. Damn.

1131
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:53,082
There it is.

1132
01:21:54,605 --> 01:21:56,694
Stop trying to capture it.

1133
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,613
You just have to let it go.

1134
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:05,137
Ed!

1135
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:08,575
Ed! We've got a problem.

1136
01:22:08,749 --> 01:22:10,142
I can't do it.

1137
01:22:11,187 --> 01:22:12,971
- The helmet?
- I've been at it for hours!

1138
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:14,930
I can't get past
the old bastard!

1139
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:17,410
I said I couldn't attune.
Now I'm the prat!

1140
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,108
What's the racket?

1141
01:22:19,282 --> 01:22:21,458
He's having
a little trouble with the helm.

1142
01:22:21,632 --> 01:22:23,721
Come on, Simon, just do it.

1143
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:27,116
Oh. Yeah, okay. Yeah.
Thanks, Holga. I'll just do it.

1144
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:30,075
This is exactly what I told you
would happen back at the tavern,

1145
01:22:30,249 --> 01:22:33,078
but you wouldn't listen. What
do you mean, you told him?

1146
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:35,167
He said to keep it
between us for morale.

1147
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:36,952
I... Do you know why?

1148
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:39,955
Because he is the most pigheaded
person I've ever known!

1149
01:22:40,129 --> 01:22:42,261
You talk us into doing things
you know won't work,

1150
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:44,481
and then you blame us
when it goes pear-shaped!

1151
01:22:44,655 --> 01:22:46,918
If you can't attune,
we'll figure out a Plan B.

1152
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,659
Plan B?
We dug up my family.

1153
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,617
We went to the Under dark
for that helmet.

1154
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,142
And you knew the whole time
that he couldn't use it?

1155
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:55,100
You humans.
You just can't help but lie.

1156
01:22:55,274 --> 01:22:57,973
I didn't lie. I really
thought Simon could do it.

1157
01:22:58,147 --> 01:23:01,063
Guys, look. We got a couple
hours till the games begin.

1158
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:03,413
This is what we do.
We pivot.

1159
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:06,111
Instead of dwelling on what
went wrong and who lied to whom,

1160
01:23:06,285 --> 01:23:08,285
let's put our heads together
and figure out a plan!

1161
01:23:08,331 --> 01:23:10,246
I'm gonna figure out
my way home.

1162
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,509
I can't believe I put
my faith in any of you.

1163
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:15,468
Yeah, I'm going too.
Sorry about Kira.

1164
01:23:17,905 --> 01:23:20,473
We'll find another way
to get her. Just not today.

1165
01:23:20,647 --> 01:23:23,694
It has to be today. We're not
done until my daughter's safe.

1166
01:23:23,868 --> 01:23:25,043
Aren't you sick of failing?

1167
01:23:25,217 --> 01:23:27,176
No! That's the whole point!

1168
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:31,571
We must never stop failing, because
the minute we do, we've failed.

1169
01:23:32,398 --> 01:23:34,313
Huh? Look,

1170
01:23:34,487 --> 01:23:38,535
none of us here can say our lives
have gone the way we had hoped for.

1171
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:40,145
Right?

1172
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:41,712
Holga.

1173
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:43,844
You left your tribe
to be with a man

1174
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,587
who left you because you were so
upset about leaving your tribe.

1175
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:50,068
And if you quit now,
that's in stone!

1176
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:52,114
Same with you, Simon.

1177
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:55,291
You're a petty thief masquerading
as a pettier sorcerer.

1178
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:58,033
You gonna go back to your show?
It's better than dying.

1179
01:23:58,207 --> 01:23:59,817
There's worse things than dying.

1180
01:23:59,991 --> 01:24:01,906
And, Doric, you have integrity,

1181
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,040
and I am sure the last thing you want
to do is tell the Emerald Enclave

1182
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:07,564
that you had a chance to save
them but you walked away.

1183
01:24:07,738 --> 01:24:10,436
Hey, You're quick to call us failures.
What about you, Ed?

1184
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:14,136
Me? I'm the champion
of failures!

1185
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:17,400
I lost everything that ever mattered
to me and it was all my fault.

1186
01:24:23,406 --> 01:24:25,625
You want to know who
really killed my wife?

1187
01:24:28,498 --> 01:24:29,629
I did.

1188
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:34,547
I decided we deserved a better life
than a Harper's oath would allow us.

1189
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,857
But I didn't know that Red
Wizards marked their treasure.

1190
01:24:42,555 --> 01:24:44,383
I led them right to our door.

1191
01:24:46,994 --> 01:24:50,128
I didn't even have the good luck
to be home when they got there.

1192
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:54,741
I failed the Harpers, I failed
my family, I failed all of you.

1193
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:56,787
Which is exactly why
I can't quit.

1194
01:24:56,961 --> 01:24:59,659
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go sit on this rock

1195
01:25:00,617 --> 01:25:02,097
and make a plan.

1196
01:25:14,848 --> 01:25:16,154
Move over.

1197
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:54,366
I 'd sit too, but there's
no more room on the rock.

1198
01:25:56,847 --> 01:25:58,109
How about this?

1199
01:25:59,415 --> 01:26:01,721
We use the Hither-Thither Staff
to get into the vault.

1200
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:03,462
No, I've explained this.

1201
01:26:03,636 --> 01:26:05,484
You can't Hither-Thither
into a room you can't see.

1202
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:06,944
I'm not saying that.

1203
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:09,425
I'm saying we put
the portal on something

1204
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:11,775
and then sneak that thing
into the vault.

1205
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:15,082
Mmm. The only thing going
in that vault is treasure.

1206
01:26:15,257 --> 01:26:17,650
So we put the portal
on some treasure.

1207
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,829
Forge did say the richest men
in Baldur's Gate and Water deep

1208
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:24,788
are bringing loot to the city.

1209
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:27,704
They'll be traveling
the High Road.

1210
01:26:27,878 --> 01:26:30,291
We could catch one of their convoys!
There'll be dozens of guards.

1211
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:32,119
Yeah, but the guards will
be guarding against people

1212
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:34,972
taking things out of their
wagon, not putting them in!

1213
01:26:35,146 --> 01:26:37,409
Holga, I could kiss you! Try it.

1214
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,937
Perfect.
Thank you so much.

1215
01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:01,450
Oh!

1216
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:29,086
Oh!

1217
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:11,215
What a profound joy
it is to welcome you,

1218
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:15,175
the good people of Never winter,
to the resumption

1219
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,004
of the High Sun Games!

1220
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:25,185
I guarantee that you are in for
the most riveting spectacle

1221
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,362
on all the Sword Coast.

1222
01:29:27,536 --> 01:29:29,799
The rules are very simple:

1223
01:29:29,973 --> 01:29:33,977
Five harrowing challenges.
Five teams of champions.

1224
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:37,372
Whoever survives to reach
the Cage of Sanctuary

1225
01:29:37,546 --> 01:29:40,462
moves on to the next stage.

1226
01:29:41,288 --> 01:29:43,465
One thing: I do urge you,

1227
01:29:43,639 --> 01:29:47,643
please do not leave the arena
till the close of the games,

1228
01:29:47,817 --> 01:29:50,080
as there will be
a wonderful gift

1229
01:29:50,254 --> 01:29:53,257
for each and every one of you!

1230
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:00,351
All right, take me down.

1231
01:30:00,525 --> 01:30:02,614
This is absurdly high.
It's not what we discussed.

1232
01:30:04,964 --> 01:30:07,227
Come on.
Gotta get it all done.

1233
01:30:16,715 --> 01:30:18,674
Oh, no. What happened?

1234
01:30:18,848 --> 01:30:21,503
It's facing the floor. Why
would they store it that way?

1235
01:30:28,161 --> 01:30:29,815
Damn it. Why does nothing
go our way?

1236
01:30:29,989 --> 01:30:31,774
Let me try.
Maybe I can make a gap.

1237
01:30:33,384 --> 01:30:34,907
The games have started.

1238
01:30:36,213 --> 01:30:39,085
We 're going to Plan C.Oh, bollocks.
What's Plan C?

1239
01:30:39,259 --> 01:30:41,653
Plan C is we go back to Plan A.

1240
01:30:41,827 --> 01:30:43,147
You're gonna attune
to the helmet.

1241
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,265
Why don't you
just call it Plan A?

1242
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,288
Plan A has a stink on it. You know
damn well I can't attune to the thing.

1243
01:30:48,312 --> 01:30:50,619
That's not true!
You couldn't attune to it.

1244
01:30:50,793 --> 01:30:53,012
Look at me.
Look at me! Huh?

1245
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:54,884
Do you remember that job
in Loudwater?

1246
01:30:55,058 --> 01:30:58,017
You couldn't spider climb until
Jolym sicced his dog on you.

1247
01:30:58,191 --> 01:31:00,150
And when we robbed
the spear of Aoth Fezim,

1248
01:31:00,324 --> 01:31:03,240
your stone skin spell failed until
the arrows were inches away.

1249
01:31:03,414 --> 01:31:07,026
Even in Triboar, you flipped
the gravity of a whole theater!

1250
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,245
You did?

1251
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,074
By accident.
It was wild magic,

1252
01:31:11,248 --> 01:31:14,294
and that only happened
because they were gonna kill me. Exactly!

1253
01:31:15,252 --> 01:31:17,515
Look, you are at your strongest

1254
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,822
when you think
you're at your weakest.

1255
01:31:19,996 --> 01:31:21,693
But you deliver.

1256
01:31:23,434 --> 01:31:26,132
You're gonna get
into that vault, okay?

1257
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:27,830
Not because you can...

1258
01:31:29,745 --> 01:31:30,963
but because you must.

1259
01:31:31,834 --> 01:31:33,836
I'm gonna keep chipping away.

1260
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:36,641
If I can get a quarter inch, I'll be
able to squeeze through as a worm.

1261
01:31:36,665 --> 01:31:37,883
As a worm!

1262
01:31:38,057 --> 01:31:39,494
As a worm, perfect.

1263
01:31:39,668 --> 01:31:41,670
You see this? Now we have
a Plan D if Plan C fails.

1264
01:31:41,844 --> 01:31:43,672
Isn't Plan D just Plan B again?

1265
01:31:43,846 --> 01:31:46,936
Plan B has a stink too. It all stinks.

1266
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:49,547
Here. Use this
to keep in contact.

1267
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:52,071
Well, um, this is a rock.

1268
01:31:52,245 --> 01:31:53,551
Actually it is...

1269
01:31:53,725 --> 01:31:55,292
a sending stone.

1270
01:31:55,466 --> 01:31:56,946
But they'll only work
for an hour.

1271
01:31:57,773 --> 01:31:59,296
Clever.

1272
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,126
So how we gonna get in there?

1273
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,389
Easy.
We just create a distraction.

1274
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:08,697
Oh, I got a good feeling
about Plan C.

1275
01:32:22,319 --> 01:32:24,060
What's your business here?

1276
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,629
What's going on?
You're messing up my song!

1277
01:32:51,653 --> 01:32:52,828
My foot is stuck.

1278
01:32:53,002 --> 01:32:54,786
Concentrate, Simon.

1279
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,096
What madness is this?

1280
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:07,930
I think they're starting
to get suspicious.

1281
01:33:11,063 --> 01:33:12,238
Nine hells.

1282
01:33:13,675 --> 01:33:15,764
There! Interlopers! Come on!

1283
01:33:23,815 --> 01:33:25,556
Kira's room should be up there.

1284
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:28,341
Find the vault
and we'll meet you. Go!

1285
01:33:28,515 --> 01:33:29,515
Halt!

1286
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:39,154
- There she is!
- Hold your weapons!

1287
01:33:39,178 --> 01:33:40,789
I'll hold them.
Find the vault.

1288
01:33:40,963 --> 01:33:43,269
You sure I can't help? I'm certain.

1289
01:33:43,443 --> 01:33:45,837
Mmm, you don't
have to be so certain. Get her!

1290
01:34:17,826 --> 01:34:20,480
Now listen carefully.

1291
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,179
I'm with the Absolution Council.
They've just gone up.

1292
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,202
Go! Quickly!

1293
01:35:06,396 --> 01:35:07,440
Open up!

1294
01:35:07,614 --> 01:35:09,399
Just a minute!

1295
01:35:29,245 --> 01:35:30,463
I don't mind that.

1296
01:35:33,815 --> 01:35:35,294
Okay, you can do this.

1297
01:35:35,468 --> 01:35:37,079
Relax. No rush.

1298
01:35:37,253 --> 01:35:38,820
There he is!

1299
01:35:42,432 --> 01:35:44,913
Look who's back.
The would-be sorcerer.

1300
01:35:45,087 --> 01:35:48,525
I don't have time for this! Yet I have
all the time there is.

1301
01:35:48,699 --> 01:35:51,049
You don't get it. We're going
to die if I don't attune!

1302
01:35:51,223 --> 01:35:54,183
So you die a fool.
It's better than to live as one.

1303
01:35:54,357 --> 01:35:56,054
That's enough!
You don't know me.

1304
01:35:56,228 --> 01:35:58,970
I know you're a stain
on your family name!

1305
01:35:59,144 --> 01:36:01,016
To hell with my name!
Let me attune!

1306
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:03,540
Not while I live. You don't live!

1307
01:36:03,714 --> 01:36:05,847
You had your time.
Now it's my turn.

1308
01:36:06,021 --> 01:36:07,196
I won't allow it.

1309
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,675
I don't care!

1310
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:11,635
Sorry.

1311
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:17,336
Took you long enough.

1312
01:36:33,657 --> 01:36:34,701
Simon!

1313
01:36:36,181 --> 01:36:37,269
Simon, was that you?

1314
01:36:37,443 --> 01:36:39,576
It was! I did it!

1315
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,969
Well done.

1316
01:36:42,013 --> 01:36:43,754
I guess it was just me
holding me back.

1317
01:36:43,928 --> 01:36:45,364
That's what I' ve been saying!

1318
01:36:54,243 --> 01:36:55,461
I made it inside the vault.

1319
01:36:55,635 --> 01:36:57,289
So did we.

1320
01:36:58,290 --> 01:36:59,988
There's nothing here.

1321
01:37:00,162 --> 01:37:02,599
What do you mean?
It's all here. Where are you?

1322
01:37:02,773 --> 01:37:03,818
Where are you?

1323
01:37:04,601 --> 01:37:06,037
I think I'm under the arena.

1324
01:37:07,996 --> 01:37:08,996
Forge.

1325
01:37:09,127 --> 01:37:10,476
This one here.

1326
01:37:28,755 --> 01:37:30,235
Oh, that's not good.

1327
01:37:38,722 --> 01:37:40,680
Simon! Doric! You there?

1328
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,378
What are you doing here?

1329
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:44,293
Kir!

1330
01:37:46,469 --> 01:37:47,687
I came for you.

1331
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:49,254
We have to go.

1332
01:37:50,168 --> 01:37:51,691
You left me.

1333
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:55,347
No. No, I know you think
I'm a liar and a bad father,

1334
01:37:55,521 --> 01:37:56,958
but...

1335
01:38:00,352 --> 01:38:01,876
I am a bad father.

1336
01:38:05,227 --> 01:38:07,011
And I did leave you.

1337
01:38:07,185 --> 01:38:09,361
And I wasn't trying
to bring your mom back.

1338
01:38:09,535 --> 01:38:10,972
I was trying to...

1339
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:13,583
bring my wife back.

1340
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,892
Which if... maybe if you had
gotten a chance to know her

1341
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:21,417
and love her like I did,
you'd understand.

1342
01:38:21,591 --> 01:38:23,419
But if you come with me now,

1343
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,900
you can have that chance.

1344
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:29,859
Hmm.

1345
01:38:48,096 --> 01:38:50,837
You 'd think you'd be
able to distinguish between

1346
01:38:51,012 --> 01:38:53,623
your own daughter
and a 300-year-old wizard.

1347
01:38:53,797 --> 01:38:55,016
Don't worry, Kira's safe.

1348
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:56,974
Unlike me, she had no idea
you were coming.

1349
01:38:57,148 --> 01:39:00,760
I don't think she knows how
tenacious you've become. Huh?

1350
01:39:02,284 --> 01:39:03,850
Look, Ed, um...

1351
01:39:06,853 --> 01:39:09,465
I'm really sorry about the
way things have worked out.

1352
01:39:10,466 --> 01:39:12,729
But I think if you were
truly honest,

1353
01:39:12,903 --> 01:39:15,819
you'd have to admit I can
give Kira a better life.

1354
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,430
I hope you can
take comfort in knowing

1355
01:39:18,604 --> 01:39:20,737
that she's with the father
she deserves, yeah?

1356
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:23,566
And now I'm in
a pickle because...

1357
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,655
I don't want to see you die.

1358
01:39:26,917 --> 01:39:30,486
Which is why
I'm gonna leave the room.

1359
01:39:33,184 --> 01:39:34,184
What?

1360
01:39:42,802 --> 01:39:45,283
If you're gonna kill us, at
least let us die with dignity.

1361
01:39:45,457 --> 01:39:48,460
How do you mean? Put us
in the High Sun Games.

1362
01:39:48,634 --> 01:39:51,028
Give us a fighting chance.
That's not a chance.

1363
01:39:51,202 --> 01:39:52,987
It's not a chance at all.

1364
01:39:53,161 --> 01:39:56,077
I mean, even if you were to
somehow survive the tournament,

1365
01:39:56,251 --> 01:39:57,687
Sofina's gonna...

1366
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:03,998
It would be much, much better for you
to die here than to go to the games.

1367
01:40:04,172 --> 01:40:07,566
No. They defeated
your men and mine.

1368
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:09,394
Let them fight in the arena.

1369
01:40:10,265 --> 01:40:12,223
They deserve that much.

1370
01:40:14,617 --> 01:40:16,880
To the games?

1371
01:40:17,054 --> 01:40:20,275
Oh. Yeah.
That was sort of a bad day.

1372
01:40:20,449 --> 01:40:21,493
Oh.

1373
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:23,191
You might want
to go back to sleep.

1374
01:40:23,365 --> 01:40:24,540
Are we...

1375
01:40:24,714 --> 01:40:26,716
In the arena.

1376
01:40:28,587 --> 01:40:31,242
This dummy talked Forge into
putting us in the games.

1377
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:33,114
Dummy? I saved our lives!

1378
01:40:33,288 --> 01:40:35,266
And I got us right above where
Doric said the treasure was.

1379
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:37,770
Isn't it a little suspect
that Sofina would agree to this?

1380
01:40:37,944 --> 01:40:40,817
Yeah, she's definitely
planned something.

1381
01:40:40,991 --> 01:40:42,732
Where under the arena were you?

1382
01:40:43,428 --> 01:40:44,777
Do you remember?

1383
01:40:45,561 --> 01:40:46,649
Not sure.

1384
01:40:47,998 --> 01:40:49,739
There was a dock down there.

1385
01:40:49,913 --> 01:40:52,742
I saw guards loading
everything onto a ship.

1386
01:40:54,657 --> 01:40:58,443
A ship. Forge wasn't hiding
the loot from us.

1387
01:40:58,617 --> 01:41:00,576
He was stealing it for himself.

1388
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:03,622
He never cared about being Lord. That
just gave him access to the vault.

1389
01:41:03,796 --> 01:41:06,316
He must have brought back the
games so the take would be bigger.

1390
01:41:07,931 --> 01:41:12,501
What about Kira? He won't leave her behind.
We have to get to that boat.

1391
01:41:12,675 --> 01:41:16,461
I don't understand. If Forge is leaving,
what does Sofina get out of this?

1392
01:41:24,948 --> 01:41:26,776
Maybe I can get us out of here.

1393
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:33,261
Magic suppression cuff.
They put one on me too.

1394
01:41:33,435 --> 01:41:35,480
And just when you were
getting good at it.

1395
01:42:36,237 --> 01:42:38,064
So we just go through the maze?

1396
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:40,154
I guess till we reach the cage?

1397
01:42:46,290 --> 01:42:47,291
Run!

1398
01:42:51,991 --> 01:42:53,167
Find the cage!

1399
01:43:02,567 --> 01:43:03,655
Follow me!

1400
01:43:13,796 --> 01:43:14,840
Whoa, whoa!

1401
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,495
Thanks.

1402
01:44:03,193 --> 01:44:05,587
- Where are the others?
- Come on, this way.

1403
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:13,334
Have you tried
Displacer Beast meat?

1404
01:44:14,073 --> 01:44:15,858
No. It's too gamey for me.

1405
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:19,514
The ship is ready, sir.

1406
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,523
It seems my ship is ready, so...

1407
01:44:29,524 --> 01:44:32,048
Kira and I will
be taking our leave.

1408
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:38,359
I do hope that our collaboration has been
as gratifying for you as it has for...

1409
01:44:38,533 --> 01:44:40,491
Get out of my city.

1410
01:44:40,665 --> 01:44:41,884
Right.

1411
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,411
Get out of the way!

1412
01:44:48,238 --> 01:44:49,413
It's burning!

1413
01:44:55,027 --> 01:44:57,029
Another minute,
I would have lost my hand.

1414
01:44:57,203 --> 01:44:58,814
Yeah, but look what
you did lose.

1415
01:44:59,554 --> 01:45:00,554
Come on.

1416
01:45:00,685 --> 01:45:02,470
Doric? Doric!

1417
01:45:02,644 --> 01:45:04,776
There must be a way
to get out of the arena.

1418
01:45:22,185 --> 01:45:23,534
Come on! Come on!

1419
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,459
Yeah. Come on!

1420
01:45:37,243 --> 01:45:38,941
No.

1421
01:45:39,115 --> 01:45:41,204
No, this isn't the way out.

1422
01:45:41,378 --> 01:45:43,748
Yes, it is. If we survive this, there'll be
another challenge and another

1423
01:45:43,772 --> 01:45:45,730
until every last person
in that cage is dead.

1424
01:45:45,904 --> 01:45:47,732
We have to find a work-around.

1425
01:45:50,126 --> 01:45:52,215
I've got an idea. Follow me.

1426
01:45:52,389 --> 01:45:53,695
No! Come back!

1427
01:45:53,869 --> 01:45:56,132
Hey! What's your idea?

1428
01:46:03,487 --> 01:46:05,097
When we hear the gong,
we jump in.

1429
01:46:05,271 --> 01:46:06,490
Into this thing?

1430
01:46:06,664 --> 01:46:08,536
You want to end up
like that guy?

1431
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:10,886
We will only be inside
for a few seconds.

1432
01:46:14,324 --> 01:46:16,413
Well, If we're all inside,
who's gonna pull us out?

1433
01:46:16,587 --> 01:46:18,589
- I will, trust me.
- Always.

1434
01:46:18,763 --> 01:46:20,069
Hold.

1435
01:46:23,289 --> 01:46:24,726
Hold.

1436
01:46:26,771 --> 01:46:27,816
Hold!

1437
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:30,079
Now!

1438
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,506
Damn it! That stings!

1439
01:47:16,386 --> 01:47:18,823
We got to move.

1440
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:28,398
I've been here.

1441
01:47:29,051 --> 01:47:30,356
Our gear.

1442
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:35,927
Simon. Try these
on your cuff.

1443
01:47:38,277 --> 01:47:39,627
Come with me.

1444
01:47:41,237 --> 01:47:43,152
Quite a second date, yeah?

1445
01:47:57,166 --> 01:47:59,081
- A trip?
- Yes.

1446
01:47:59,255 --> 01:48:01,538
Something urgent has come up, but
if we leave now we'll be safe.

1447
01:48:01,562 --> 01:48:02,563
Safe from what?

1448
01:48:04,782 --> 01:48:07,306
What is this? This is an ambush.

1449
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:09,801
On the boat you were gonna use
to escape from Never winter.

1450
01:48:09,874 --> 01:48:11,310
Dad. Hi, honey.

1451
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,791
Hey, Forge, why don't you
tell her what this is?

1452
01:48:15,314 --> 01:48:18,187
I don't know. It's the
Tablet of Reawakening, Kira.

1453
01:48:18,361 --> 01:48:20,276
It's the reason why I left you.

1454
01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:22,408
Your dad's been
telling you the truth, Bug.

1455
01:48:22,583 --> 01:48:25,063
It's Uncle Forge
who's been feeding you lies.

1456
01:48:26,891 --> 01:48:29,198
It's rubbish.
It's just rubbish!

1457
01:48:29,372 --> 01:48:30,852
Come with me, Kir.

1458
01:48:31,809 --> 01:48:34,072
We'll go home, bring back Mom.

1459
01:48:35,247 --> 01:48:37,206
We can be a family again.

1460
01:48:40,905 --> 01:48:42,211
You're not taking my money.

1461
01:48:44,082 --> 01:48:46,432
Put down the tablet and get off
my ship, all of you.

1462
01:48:46,607 --> 01:48:48,652
Now! Okay. Okay. Okay.

1463
01:48:48,826 --> 01:48:50,175
What are you doing?

1464
01:48:50,349 --> 01:48:51,849
It's all right.
Shush, my darling, be quiet.

1465
01:48:51,873 --> 01:48:53,570
It's going down.
Just don't hurt her.

1466
01:48:53,744 --> 01:48:55,137
See that, Kira?

1467
01:48:55,311 --> 01:48:57,269
Your father knows me.

1468
01:48:57,443 --> 01:49:00,490
He knows I'm prepared
to do terrible things

1469
01:49:00,664 --> 01:49:02,057
to get what I want.

1470
01:49:02,884 --> 01:49:05,582
Even to those I care about most.

1471
01:49:07,366 --> 01:49:10,848
In the end, that's all
that separates the beggar...

1472
01:49:23,774 --> 01:49:25,559
Nobody hurts my Bug.

1473
01:49:27,604 --> 01:49:29,171
Simon, get us out of here!

1474
01:49:36,657 --> 01:49:38,049
Sorry, Ed.

1475
01:49:43,098 --> 01:49:44,403
Sorry, Forge!

1476
01:49:59,027 --> 01:50:00,681
What's that one on about? Who knows?

1477
01:50:00,855 --> 01:50:02,508
Twenty thousand
on the Gray Hands!

1478
01:50:08,645 --> 01:50:10,342
I'm sorry I believed him.

1479
01:50:11,779 --> 01:50:13,650
What? What are you
talking about?

1480
01:50:13,824 --> 01:50:16,784
You have nothing
to apologize for.

1481
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:19,874
I should have done
so many things differently.

1482
01:50:21,179 --> 01:50:24,443
I had a whole apology,
but I sort of gave it to Sofina.

1483
01:50:25,793 --> 01:50:27,838
I love you, Kir.

1484
01:50:28,012 --> 01:50:31,189
And nothing will ever get in
the way of that again, okay?

1485
01:50:31,712 --> 01:50:32,713
Promise.

1486
01:50:38,153 --> 01:50:40,329
I love you too, Dad.

1487
01:50:40,503 --> 01:50:42,940
It's good to have you back, kid.

1488
01:50:43,114 --> 01:50:45,943
Do you know how much loot
is on this ship?

1489
01:50:47,815 --> 01:50:49,227
I'm surprised
the boat can float.

1490
01:50:49,251 --> 01:50:52,384
All right. So, we're gonna
need to lay low.

1491
01:50:53,037 --> 01:50:54,517
What is that?

1492
01:51:07,443 --> 01:51:09,358
It's the Beckoning Death.

1493
01:51:09,532 --> 01:51:11,882
That's why she needed Forge.

1494
01:51:12,056 --> 01:51:14,668
The games brought the city
together for the spell.

1495
01:51:15,581 --> 01:51:17,888
Szass Tam is taking Never winter.

1496
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:29,421
Well, shit.

1497
01:51:38,517 --> 01:51:40,519
So what do we do
when we get there?

1498
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:44,045
Working on it. Simon, what did you say
the range was in that portal staff?

1499
01:51:44,219 --> 01:51:46,047
A quarter mile. Why?

1500
01:51:47,178 --> 01:51:49,920
I'm gonna keep that promise
I made to Xenk.

1501
01:51:58,537 --> 01:52:00,670
Whatever that is,
stop it. Now!

1502
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,110
Look! She's Thayan!

1503
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,245
Please! Please stop!

1504
01:52:31,527 --> 01:52:34,486
You there! Harbor master person.
Are you seeing this?

1505
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:37,228
As Lord of Never winter,
I demand a ship and crew

1506
01:52:37,402 --> 01:52:39,578
to chase down
five people who have...

1507
01:52:46,324 --> 01:52:48,500
What is this? No!

1508
01:52:58,815 --> 01:53:01,035
It's the gift Forge promised!

1509
01:53:20,402 --> 01:53:22,099
No! No! No!

1510
01:53:22,273 --> 01:53:24,798
No, no, no! No! No!

1511
01:53:24,972 --> 01:53:26,800
No!

1512
01:53:28,497 --> 01:53:30,281
That's for you.
Enjoy that.

1513
01:53:31,152 --> 01:53:32,153
All right.

1514
01:53:33,154 --> 01:53:35,069
This isn't over until
we take her out.

1515
01:53:36,026 --> 01:53:38,420
Whatever happens to us,
stay hidden.

1516
01:53:39,073 --> 01:53:40,335
Use your pendant.

1517
01:53:51,172 --> 01:53:53,000
Where do you think she's gone?

1518
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:33,997
She missed.

1519
01:55:49,159 --> 01:55:50,378
You all right?

1520
01:56:08,222 --> 01:56:09,788
What do we do
when we get to her?

1521
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:11,181
I got this.

1522
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:18,596
You know not
the scope of my power!

1523
01:57:35,483 --> 01:57:37,137
Enough!

1524
01:57:40,270 --> 01:57:42,011
It's another Time Stop!

1525
01:57:42,185 --> 01:57:45,232
Simon, can you counter it? I can't.
She's still too strong!

1526
01:57:45,884 --> 01:57:47,147
I'm so sorr...

1527
01:57:51,455 --> 01:57:53,240
For too long

1528
01:57:53,414 --> 01:57:56,721
I endured the arrogance
of Forge Fitzwilliam.

1529
01:57:56,895 --> 01:57:58,767
The false charm.

1530
01:57:58,941 --> 01:58:01,204
The quips.

1531
01:58:01,378 --> 01:58:04,077
And just as I begin
to purge this place

1532
01:58:04,251 --> 01:58:08,385
of its living filth,
you dare interpose.

1533
01:58:12,128 --> 01:58:15,392
Now, as you die,

1534
01:58:15,566 --> 01:58:18,003
rest assured
it will not be the end.

1535
01:58:18,787 --> 01:58:23,357
For you will forever suffer.

1536
01:58:25,663 --> 01:58:29,102
I'm sorry, your breath
just smells like... old clothes.

1537
01:58:29,276 --> 01:58:30,712
It's bad.

1538
01:58:35,543 --> 01:58:36,761
What is this?

1539
01:58:36,935 --> 01:58:39,721
I countered your Time Stop.
I got better.

1540
01:58:39,895 --> 01:58:42,680
We had to distract you
so Kira could slap on that cuff

1541
01:58:42,854 --> 01:58:44,682
and so Doric could do this.

1542
01:58:50,862 --> 01:58:52,516
I think you got her.

1543
01:59:05,094 --> 01:59:07,879
I honestly didn't think
that plan was gonna work.

1544
01:59:08,576 --> 01:59:10,317
You assured us it would.

1545
01:59:10,491 --> 01:59:12,188
Hey, Holga!

1546
01:59:16,105 --> 01:59:18,063
Did we get her? Holga?

1547
01:59:19,021 --> 01:59:21,980
Yeah.
Yeah, we got her.

1548
01:59:22,807 --> 01:59:24,113
Oh, that's... Oh, God.

1549
01:59:24,287 --> 01:59:25,636
That's not a good spot, is it?

1550
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:27,812
No, it's not... it's not bad.

1551
01:59:28,987 --> 01:59:29,987
Here.

1552
01:59:30,075 --> 01:59:32,121
Simon! Simon, help her.

1553
01:59:33,383 --> 01:59:36,734
It's a Red Wizard's blade.
There's nothing I can do.

1554
01:59:39,346 --> 01:59:41,043
Hey. Hey.

1555
01:59:41,217 --> 01:59:42,934
We're gonna patch you up.
It's not gonna be a problem.

1556
01:59:42,958 --> 01:59:44,133
Please don't go.

1557
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:46,831
Easy, Bug, easy. Please don't go.

1558
01:59:47,005 --> 01:59:48,224
Don't mourn me.

1559
01:59:48,398 --> 01:59:50,444
No, no, no. No final words.

1560
01:59:50,618 --> 01:59:53,142
No final words. I'm
proud of what I did here.

1561
01:59:53,316 --> 01:59:55,405
I'm dying a hero.

1562
01:59:56,711 --> 01:59:58,321
And you...

1563
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:01,846
You're a good man.

1564
02:00:02,499 --> 02:00:04,022
A real Harper.

1565
02:00:05,023 --> 02:00:07,200
Shut up. I'm a moron,
you know that.

1566
02:00:07,852 --> 02:00:09,332
Promise me something.

1567
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:11,595
Yeah, anything.

1568
02:00:11,769 --> 02:00:14,424
That you're gonna take
good care of our girl.

1569
02:00:15,773 --> 02:00:18,211
She's the best thing
you ever did.

1570
02:00:19,995 --> 02:00:21,431
I will.

1571
02:00:50,373 --> 02:00:51,548
No.

1572
02:00:52,854 --> 02:00:54,072
No!

1573
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,901
I need you.

1574
02:00:59,034 --> 02:01:01,515
I need you.

1575
02:01:58,267 --> 02:02:00,617
We can only use it once.

1576
02:02:04,099 --> 02:02:05,143
I know.

1577
02:02:13,804 --> 02:02:14,936
Holga Kilgore.

1578
02:02:31,735 --> 02:02:34,521
Don't tell me
you wasted it on me.

1579
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:37,785
Why would you do that?

1580
02:03:00,285 --> 02:03:02,853
Szass Tam won't
be happy about this.

1581
02:03:03,027 --> 02:03:04,725
Well, if he comes after us,
we'll be ready.

1582
02:03:04,899 --> 02:03:06,553
We?

1583
02:03:06,727 --> 02:03:08,685
Oh, that's right. You
don't like humans, do you?

1584
02:03:10,992 --> 02:03:12,123
Some are okay.

1585
02:03:13,951 --> 02:03:15,562
What about you? Hmm?

1586
02:03:15,736 --> 02:03:18,608
Going back to the Harpers?
Be with your people?

1587
02:03:20,305 --> 02:03:21,916
I'm with my people.

1588
02:03:24,092 --> 02:03:25,833
So, uh,

1589
02:03:26,007 --> 02:03:30,228
I know my last attempt to court
you was quite bad.

1590
02:03:30,403 --> 02:03:34,102
But I wonder if you'd consider
having another go at it?

1591
02:03:36,713 --> 02:03:37,845
Yeah, all right. Yeah?

1592
02:03:38,019 --> 02:03:39,760
Calm down.Right.

1593
02:03:47,768 --> 02:03:50,161
Damn! Bloody chalice.

1594
02:04:08,745 --> 02:04:10,051
Good evening.

1595
02:04:11,574 --> 02:04:13,837
Of course, you know
what happened after that.

1596
02:04:14,011 --> 02:04:15,926
With Sofina's magic expunged,

1597
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,059
Lord Neverember finally came to.

1598
02:04:20,235 --> 02:04:22,237
His first official act
was to award

1599
02:04:22,411 --> 02:04:25,370
the saviors of Never winter
the Medal of Heroism.

1600
02:04:26,415 --> 02:04:28,112
And to the Emerald Enclave,

1601
02:04:28,286 --> 02:04:31,768
he granted formal protection
of their people and their land.

1602
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:41,212
One could argue that my actions,
reprehensible though they were,

1603
02:04:41,386 --> 02:04:43,998
led to a virtual renaissance
for the city.

1604
02:04:44,172 --> 02:04:47,567
And while I've only served the first
year of my sentence, I have to say,

1605
02:04:47,741 --> 02:04:49,003
it has been

1606
02:04:50,134 --> 02:04:51,484
eye-opening.

1607
02:04:52,572 --> 02:04:55,052
I have taken a look inside

1608
02:04:55,749 --> 02:04:57,402
and I've asked myself,

1609
02:04:58,447 --> 02:04:59,840
'What's going on in there?'

1610
02:05:01,189 --> 02:05:06,411
And, you know, I realized
a lot of it goes back to my mum.

1611
02:05:07,674 --> 02:05:10,241
She was a stern woman,
prone to fits of...

1612
02:05:10,415 --> 02:05:12,505
Stop, stop!
We've heard enough.

1613
02:05:14,245 --> 02:05:16,117
Pardon denied.

1614
02:05:16,291 --> 02:05:18,728
This session is adjourned.

1615
02:05:23,646 --> 02:05:24,647
Jarnathan!

1616
02:05:30,261 --> 02:05:32,394
No, no! I'm terribly sorry.

1617
02:05:32,568 --> 02:05:35,484
I don't know what came over me,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

1618
02:07:47,311 --> 02:07:48,486
Hello?

1619
02:07:50,097 --> 02:07:53,143
Can somebody please
ask me another question?

1620
02:07:54,579 --> 02:07:55,624
Anyone?
