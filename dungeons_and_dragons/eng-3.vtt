1
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:04,629
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's them!</font>

2
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,155
<font face="Serif" size="18">Get ready.</font>

3
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:11,071
<font face="Serif" size="18">Two more prisoners coming in!</font>

4
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:14,204
<font face="Serif" size="18">Prepare for docking!</font>

5
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,859
<font face="Serif" size="18">In position!</font>

6
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,210
<font face="Serif" size="18">Easy!</font>

7
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,742
<font face="Serif" size="18">Gate secure!</font>

8
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,154
<font face="Serif" size="18">Prisoner walking!</font>

9
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,965
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, great.
Another cellmate.</font>

10
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,533
<font face="Serif" size="18">No offense, pal.
You seem lovely.</font>

11
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:26,668
<font face="Serif" size="18">Uh... Let's show you around.
Get you situated here.</font>

12
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:31,238
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is the bucket where
our pee freezes. And, um...</font>

13
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,064
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, that's it.</font>

14
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,850
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's your name, lass?</font>

15
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,679
<font face="Serif" size="18">Uh, That's Holga.
I'm Edgin. And you are?</font>

16
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:42,640
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've been in a lot of cells.
Never shared one with a female.</font>

17
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,120
<font face="Serif" size="18">Think I'm gonna like it.</font>

18
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,296
<font face="Serif" size="18">Word of advice,</font>

19
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga doesn't love to be disturbed
while she's eating her potatoes.</font>

20
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,519
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kind of the highlight
of her day. Shut up, you!</font>

21
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:53,651
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sure thing. Have at it.</font>

22
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,350
<font face="Serif" size="18">Little shy, eh?</font>

23
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,701
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm not so bad once
you get to know me.</font>

24
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,137
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mmm.</font>

25
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,574
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don't be like that.</font>

26
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,012
<font face="Serif" size="18">We could be very happy to...</font>

27
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,370
<font face="Serif" size="18">I think I'm gonna do this without
fingers and make it a mitten.</font>

28
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,807
<font face="Serif" size="18">Who am I trying to impress?</font>

29
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,735
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oi! Stop that singing!</font>

30
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:35,911
<font face="Serif" size="18">You got it, Tobias.</font>

31
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,436
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Absolution Council
is tomorrow.</font>

32
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:41,786
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don't get your hopes up, Ed.</font>

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,614
<font face="Serif" size="18">What are you talking about?</font>

34
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,661
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jarnathan is on the council
this time. He's an Aarakocra.</font>

35
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,750
<font face="Serif" size="18">If anyone's gonna free us,
it's him.</font>

36
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,404
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not gonna happen.</font>

37
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:54,364
<font face="Serif" size="18">I tell you, Holga, this is
your last day chopping ice.</font>

38
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,762
<font face="Serif" size="18">By authority
of the Lords' Alliance,</font>

39
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:04,505
<font face="Serif" size="18">this Absolution Council
will now come to order</font>

40
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:09,684
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the case of Edgin Darvis
and Holga Kilgore.</font>

41
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:14,254
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is the second year of
incarceration for the crimes</font>

42
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:17,866
<font face="Serif" size="18">of grand larceny
and skullduggery.</font>

43
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,175
<font face="Serif" size="18">It is the task of this council to
determine your eligibility for pardon.</font>

44
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,047
<font face="Serif" size="18">What say you?</font>

45
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:28,529
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you, Chancellor Anderton,
esteemed members of the council.</font>

46
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:34,404
<font face="Serif" size="18">Before I begin, I notice that
Chancellor Jarnathan is not present.</font>

47
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:36,188
<font face="Serif" size="18">Should we perhaps wait?</font>

48
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:39,627
<font face="Serif" size="18">Chancellor Jarnathan was delayed
by the storm. You may begin.</font>

49
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,368
<font face="Serif" size="18">I see. It's just that I...</font>

50
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,849
<font face="Serif" size="18">We were really counting
on him to attend.</font>

51
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:47,199
<font face="Serif" size="18">Begin or waive your statement.</font>

52
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,853
<font face="Serif" size="18">Very well.</font>

53
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,510
<font face="Serif" size="18">I should start
by giving you some context.</font>

54
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,079
<font face="Serif" size="18">You may be surprised to learn
I wasn't always a thief.</font>

55
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:01,126
<font face="Serif" size="18">Years ago, I became a member
of the Harpers faction,</font>

56
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,129
<font face="Serif" size="18">a network of spies who
swear an oath to fight tyranny,</font>

57
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,655
<font face="Serif" size="18">defend the oppressed
and to ask nothing in return.</font>

58
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,659
<font face="Serif" size="18">My wife, Zia, supported my decision,
even though she knew the risks.</font>

59
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,533
<font face="Serif" size="18">By day,
I'd eavesdrop on mercenaries,</font>

60
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,058
<font face="Serif" size="18">stop bandits in their tracks...</font>

61
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,803
<font face="Serif" size="18">and even bring
Thayan Red Wizards to justice.</font>

62
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:33,333
<font face="Serif" size="18">By night, I'd come home to my
loving wife, and daughter, Kira.</font>

63
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,988
<font face="Serif" size="18">To be honest, there were times
when I began to question</font>

64
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:40,601
<font face="Serif" size="18">the 'asking nothing in return'
part of my oath.</font>

65
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,733
<font face="Serif" size="18">But my wife would always say,</font>

66
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:45,649
<font face="Serif" size="18">'You don't have to give us everything,
you only have to give us you.'</font>

67
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:47,061
<font face="Serif" size="18">So what's the latest
on Jarnathan?</font>

68
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:49,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">Is he close by?
Because I can wait.</font>

69
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,263
<font face="Serif" size="18">Did you not hear what we said?
Right, the storm.</font>

70
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,614
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's just that based on
what I know about Jarnathan,</font>

71
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,790
<font face="Serif" size="18">I think he'd be especially
receptive to my story.</font>

72
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,966
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I'd hate to have to wait
a whole other year</font>

73
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,229
<font face="Serif" size="18">to come back in here
and... Proceed.</font>

74
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,013
<font face="Serif" size="18">Absolutely. Here we go.</font>

75
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,581
<font face="Serif" size="18">When you're a Harper,
you're bound to make enemies.</font>

76
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,064
<font face="Serif" size="18">And sometimes those enemies
come looking for revenge.</font>

77
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,900
<font face="Serif" size="18">No cleric can repair the damage
from a Red Wizard's blade.</font>

78
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,946
<font face="Serif" size="18">There was no way to revive her.</font>

79
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:10,038
<font face="Serif" size="18">When Zia died,
so did my devotion to my oath.</font>

80
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,147
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm sorry, it's just hard
to relive this...</font>

81
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,194
<font face="Serif" size="18">- without Jarnathan here.
- Again with this?</font>

82
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,521
<font face="Serif" size="18">But he missed the most
important part of my back story!</font>

83
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,677
<font face="Serif" size="18">How can he judge me
without knowing my motivation?</font>

84
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:44,376
<font face="Serif" size="18">We are entirely capable of deciding
your case without Jarnathan.</font>

85
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,205
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Get on with it!
- Fine. Where was I? Uh...</font>

86
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,731
<font face="Serif" size="18">By night, I'd come home to my
loving wife, and daughter Kira.</font>

87
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,559
<font face="Serif" size="18">You went back too far.
Stop stalling!</font>

88
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,213
<font face="Serif" size="18">Right, sorry.
Yeah, broad strokes.</font>

89
00:07:55,387 --> 00:08:00,218
<font face="Serif" size="18">The next few months
were among my most shameful.</font>

90
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,309
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's when I met Holga.</font>

91
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,224
<font face="Serif" size="18">She took pity on me.</font>

92
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,967
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, she took pity on the baby.</font>

93
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:12,709
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga was a fellow resident
of rock bottom.</font>

94
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,583
<font face="Serif" size="18">Many years before, she'd
been cast out of her tribe</font>

95
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:18,410
<font face="Serif" size="18">for falling in love
with an outsider.</font>

96
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:25,461
<font face="Serif" size="18">We quickly became like
brother and sister.</font>

97
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:29,073
<font face="Serif" size="18">With a relationship built
on trust and mutual respect.</font>

98
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,079
<font face="Serif" size="18">Neither of us had money
or an honest way to earn it,</font>

99
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:39,127
<font face="Serif" size="18">so we decided to table 'honest'
and we tried something new.</font>

100
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,522
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's intoxicating
when you realize</font>

101
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:46,134
<font face="Serif" size="18">that what separates you
from what you've always wanted</font>

102
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:49,224
<font face="Serif" size="18">can be as thin
as a pane of glass.</font>

103
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:06,284
<font face="Serif" size="18">You may be wondering how we could
carry on this criminal lifestyle</font>

104
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,721
<font face="Serif" size="18">with a young girl at home.</font>

105
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,593
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, we didn't
leave her at home.</font>

106
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,857
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hurry, hurry!
Run, run, run!</font>

107
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,599
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kira wasn't
the only new recruit.</font>

108
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:19,341
<font face="Serif" size="18">We also added Simon,
a so-so sorcerer,</font>

109
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:23,563
<font face="Serif" size="18">and a con man named Forge, who
pushed us to aim even higher.</font>

110
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:30,004
<font face="Serif" size="18">Before long, we became a team.</font>

111
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:32,659
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes, we were thieves,</font>

112
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,183
<font face="Serif" size="18">but I tried to hold us
to a certain standard.</font>

113
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,924
<font face="Serif" size="18">We never harmed anyone.</font>

114
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:40,057
<font face="Serif" size="18">And we only robbed from those
who would feel it the least.</font>

115
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:45,802
<font face="Serif" size="18">But everything changed
when we met the wizard Sofina.</font>

116
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,631
<font face="Serif" size="18">We knew almost nothing
about her.</font>

117
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,895
<font face="Serif" size="18">Only that she wanted our help
in robbing Korinn's Keep.</font>

118
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,724
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's a Harper stronghold.
I don't know if you've heard of it.</font>

119
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:57,031
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm sure Jarnathan has.</font>

120
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:00,251
<font face="Serif" size="18">The keep was filled with the priceless
relics seized from evildoers,</font>

121
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,993
<font face="Serif" size="18">and only Harpers could
gain access to the vault.</font>

122
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,300
<font face="Serif" size="18">Which is why Sofina came to us.</font>

123
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:08,651
<font face="Serif" size="18">At first, I refused.
I wouldn't stoop that low.</font>

124
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,611
<font face="Serif" size="18">But then Forge told me that among
the relics in Korinn's Keep,</font>

125
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,917
<font face="Serif" size="18">there was
a Tablet of Reawakening,</font>

126
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:17,312
<font face="Serif" size="18">capable of bringing back
a single deceased person.</font>

127
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:20,054
<font face="Serif" size="18">Even one killed
by a Red Wizard's blade.</font>

128
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,360
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can probably see
where this is going.</font>

129
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,886
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why can't I come? Sorry, Kir,
this one's too dangerous.</font>

130
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,844
<font face="Serif" size="18">Then you shouldn't go.</font>

131
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,325
<font face="Serif" size="18">We have everything that we need.</font>

132
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,415
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not yet.
But this is the last one.</font>

133
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,635
<font face="Serif" size="18">Trust me.</font>

134
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:42,467
<font face="Serif" size="18">Chin up, Bug.
We'll be right back.</font>

135
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,322
<font face="Serif" size="18">I didn't tell her
about the tablet.</font>

136
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,186
<font face="Serif" size="18">It would break her heart
if it all went to shit.</font>

137
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,821
<font face="Serif" size="18">And, well,</font>

138
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,953
<font face="Serif" size="18">to shit it went.</font>

139
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,724
<font face="Serif" size="18">See you soon, love.</font>

140
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,129
<font face="Serif" size="18">Intruders!</font>

141
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:36,825
<font face="Serif" size="18">There they are!</font>

142
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,964
<font face="Serif" size="18">We don't hurt anyone.</font>

143
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,678
<font face="Serif" size="18">She's caught in the Time Stop!
Counter it, Simon!</font>

144
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:04,680
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can't.
Sofina's too powerful.</font>

145
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,737
<font face="Serif" size="18">Take the tablet.
Keep Kira safe.</font>

146
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,873
<font face="Serif" size="18">You have my word.</font>

147
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:38,061
<font face="Serif" size="18">The truth is, even if this council were
to sentence me to another two years,</font>

148
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,716
<font face="Serif" size="18">or 20 for that matter,</font>

149
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,721
<font face="Serif" size="18">it would never be punishment enough
for the worst crime I ever committed...</font>

150
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,899
<font face="Serif" size="18">robbing my daughter
of her father.</font>

151
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:53,685
<font face="Serif" size="18">But know that,
if you do choose to free me,</font>

152
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,950
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'll spend the rest of my days
trying to right that wrong.</font>

153
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,953
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anything you want to add?</font>

154
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,432
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm good.</font>

155
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,788
<font face="Serif" size="18">Before you announce
your decision,</font>

156
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:11,834
<font face="Serif" size="18">I implore you
to please wait for...</font>

157
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,664
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jarnathan! Pardon my belatedness.</font>

158
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,362
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can't tell you how happy
I am to see you! Step away!</font>

159
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:21,104
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga, now! Guards!</font>

160
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:23,106
<font face="Serif" size="18">Release me, sir!</font>

161
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,282
<font face="Serif" size="18">She's throwing potatoes!</font>

162
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,328
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, Jarnathan!</font>

163
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,853
<font face="Serif" size="18">But we approved your pardon!</font>

164
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,738
<font face="Serif" size="18">Fly, bird, fly!</font>

165
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,807
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's still breathing.</font>

166
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,464
<font face="Serif" size="18">I told you he'd get us out!</font>

167
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,053
<font face="Serif" size="18">Any sign of Kira?</font>

168
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,491
<font face="Serif" size="18">Been empty for a while.</font>

169
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,422
<font face="Serif" size="18">Where do you think
Forge took her?</font>

170
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,773
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can't see him leaving the Sword Coast.
Forge always liked cities.</font>

171
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,299
<font face="Serif" size="18">Some supper
for you and your wife?</font>

172
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,866
<font face="Serif" size="18">What? No.
She's not my wife. Me with that?</font>

173
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,869
<font face="Serif" size="18">With those lips? That's so gross.
Just the drinks.</font>

174
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,049
<font face="Serif" size="18">So, we take a boat
down to Baldur's Gate</font>

175
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,094
<font face="Serif" size="18">and then head north.</font>

176
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:08,706
<font face="Serif" size="18">And while we're looking for
Forge, I'll pay Marlamin a visit.</font>

177
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,350
<font face="Serif" size="18">You sure you really want
to put yourself through that?</font>

178
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:15,887
<font face="Serif" size="18">What if he doesn't want to talk to you?
It's not about what he wants.</font>

179
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,802
<font face="Serif" size="18">Okay. It's about closure.</font>

180
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,327
<font face="Serif" size="18">He sent you a letter saying
he wasn't your husband anymore.</font>

181
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,503
<font face="Serif" size="18">Wasn't that closure?</font>

182
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,244
<font face="Serif" size="18">You wouldn't understand. I don't.</font>

183
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,376
<font face="Serif" size="18">I clearly, clearly don't.</font>

184
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,904
<font face="Serif" size="18">Is that...</font>

185
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,820
<font face="Serif" size="18">Son of a bitch.</font>

186
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">Forge is Lord of Never winter.</font>

187
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,870
<font face="Serif" size="18">How did that clown
pull that off?</font>

188
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,133
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, as long as he's got Kira,
I don't care.</font>

189
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,092
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on. Let's go.</font>

190
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,225
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thanks, pal.
What's wrong with my lips?</font>

191
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,532
<font face="Serif" size="18">They're too big
for your face. What?</font>

192
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:52,866
<font face="Serif" size="18">A lot of people like my lips.</font>

193
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,348
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've never seen
this place so crowded.</font>

194
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,177
<font face="Serif" size="18">Must be coming in
for the High Sun Games.</font>

195
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:31,441
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, my dad took me to the
last one before they were outlawed.</font>

196
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,095
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anyone win?</font>

197
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,445
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, one contestant made it
to the final round</font>

198
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,144
<font face="Serif" size="18">before a monster ate
his upper body, so...</font>

199
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:40,407
<font face="Serif" size="18">no.</font>

200
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,717
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's nice to see that Forge
hasn't lost his sense of modesty.</font>

201
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,812
<font face="Serif" size="18">How long has it been? Two years.</font>

202
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,945
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, how long have
we been waiting here?</font>

203
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,427
<font face="Serif" size="18">Dad.</font>

204
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:02,603
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga?</font>

205
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,213
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kira.</font>

206
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,479
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh!</font>

207
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,308
<font face="Serif" size="18">- I missed you so much.
- Hello, Bug.</font>

208
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:16,747
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Come here.
- Hi.</font>

209
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,314
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh.</font>

210
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,013
<font face="Serif" size="18">I thought about you every day.</font>

211
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:27,845
<font face="Serif" size="18">I made you these.</font>

212
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,460
<font face="Serif" size="18">- What are they?
- Mittens!</font>

213
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:36,550
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh. Thanks.</font>

214
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,900
<font face="Serif" size="18">Have you been okay?</font>

215
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,295
<font face="Serif" size="18">Uncle Forge has been
very good to me.</font>

216
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,340
<font face="Serif" size="18">'Uncle' Forge?</font>

217
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on.
He wants to see you.</font>

218
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:53,262
<font face="Serif" size="18">I still wear the pendant
you got me, Holga.</font>

219
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:56,874
<font face="Serif" size="18">I use it to sneak around
the castle sometimes.</font>

220
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,531
<font face="Serif" size="18">So strange that you're here.
Hey, Kir, look.</font>

221
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:07,407
<font face="Serif" size="18">I want you to know I am so sorry
for how things turned out.</font>

222
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,626
<font face="Serif" size="18">I took a risk.</font>

223
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,193
<font face="Serif" size="18">And it didn't pay off.</font>

224
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,195
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why do you look mad at me?</font>

225
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,330
<font face="Serif" size="18">Because you're acting like
it wasn't your fault.</font>

226
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,549
<font face="Serif" size="18">There they are!</font>

227
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,596
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh!</font>

228
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,293
<font face="Serif" size="18">Old friends.</font>

229
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:27,122
<font face="Serif" size="18">What a wonderful surprise. Come.</font>

230
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:31,996
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh?</font>

231
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,043
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do I spy a little bit of gray?</font>

232
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,392
<font face="Serif" size="18">I do. I like it.</font>

233
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,829
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's scoundrelly
but professorial.</font>

234
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,571
<font face="Serif" size="18">You look like a...
What do you look like?</font>

235
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,748
<font face="Serif" size="18">You look like a well-read
fisherman with secrets.</font>

236
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,099
<font face="Serif" size="18">And Holga.</font>

237
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,059
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know you don't like hugs.</font>

238
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,887
<font face="Serif" size="18">But I need one. Yes?</font>

239
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,020
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Oh.
- Mmm. Mmm.</font>

240
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,805
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mmm! Mmm.</font>

241
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,373
<font face="Serif" size="18">These last years
must have been dreadful,</font>

242
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,027
<font face="Serif" size="18">but I tell you what,
I did think you'd serve longer.</font>

243
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,858
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh! Uh, we... We got an...
early release.</font>

244
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,817
<font face="Serif" size="18">Good behavior. Yeah, behaving good.</font>

245
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,819
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ah. I see.</font>

246
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,213
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, welcome. Welcome back.</font>

247
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:17,520
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, that's blistering.
That's blisteringly hot.</font>

248
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:19,087
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yet again.</font>

249
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,568
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kira, we really should speak
to the kitchen staff,</font>

250
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,092
<font face="Serif" size="18">because there's simply no need
for it to be this hot.</font>

251
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:28,096
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, yeah, the tea's hot. So, how
are you the Lord of Never winter?</font>

252
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:33,623
<font face="Serif" size="18">Right. Before you went off to prison,
you charged me with Kira's well-being.</font>

253
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,234
<font face="Serif" size="18">Didn't think much of it
at the time.</font>

254
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,280
<font face="Serif" size="18">But there came a moment
when I looked into her eyes,</font>

255
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,935
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I suddenly knew
I had to be a better man.</font>

256
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,807
<font face="Serif" size="18">Obviously, I couldn't give back
the treasures we'd stolen,</font>

257
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:45,766
<font face="Serif" size="18">so when Lord Neverember
fell ill,</font>

258
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,770
<font face="Serif" size="18">I seized the chance to try and,
you know, make a difference.</font>

259
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:52,314
<font face="Serif" size="18">And the money from Korinn's Keep
paved the way for my campaign.</font>

260
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,165
<font face="Serif" size="18">But I will tell you this...</font>

261
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,231
<font face="Serif" size="18">Couldn't have done it alone.</font>

262
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,474
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ah! And here she is!</font>

263
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,607
<font face="Serif" size="18">You remember Sofina.</font>

264
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,349
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're still working with her?
She's the one that got us caught.</font>

265
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:06,787
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not true, no. Without her,
we all would have been caught.</font>

266
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:08,832
<font face="Serif" size="18">And since then,
she has become...</font>

267
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:12,314
<font face="Serif" size="18">my top adviser. Mmm.</font>

268
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,884
<font face="Serif" size="18">The tea is scorching, I do apologize.
It's scorching hot.</font>

269
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,234
<font face="Serif" size="18">Um, Sofina.</font>

270
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,672
<font face="Serif" size="18">Would you mind very much, um...</font>

271
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,587
<font face="Serif" size="18">Certainly.</font>

272
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:29,939
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hmm.</font>

273
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">Good. Thank you. I... I'm...</font>

274
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:36,033
<font face="Serif" size="18">I didn't realize you were gonna
put your finger in the cup, so...</font>

275
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,949
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm gonna leave that for later.</font>

276
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:42,518
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, if you'll give us the tablet,
Kira, Holga and I will be on our way.</font>

277
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:45,782
<font face="Serif" size="18">Of course that's why
you came back.</font>

278
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,219
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, it wasn't for me. It was
for that Tablet of Riches.</font>

279
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,830
<font face="Serif" size="18">Riches?</font>

280
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:53,268
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, it 's... it's
the Tablet of Reawakening.</font>

281
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:54,522
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm sorry, what's this now?</font>

282
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,141
<font face="Serif" size="18">The reason why
I agreed to the heist.</font>

283
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,014
<font face="Serif" size="18">Is that what he's told you?
That I left you for more riches?</font>

284
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:02,669
<font face="Serif" size="18">I told her the truth.
She has a right to know it.</font>

285
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,846
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's been lying to you, Kira.</font>

286
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,979
<font face="Serif" size="18">I wanted to... I wanted
to bring your mother back.</font>

287
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:11,895
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, Ed, come on. Look, I know how
much you crave her forgiveness,</font>

288
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,810
<font face="Serif" size="18">but I promise you,
more lies is not the way.</font>

289
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,638
<font face="Serif" size="18">You snake!</font>

290
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,075
<font face="Serif" size="18">You know damn well
what he was after.</font>

291
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,861
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why wouldn't you tell me
if you were doing it for Mom?</font>

292
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:23,820
<font face="Serif" size="18">Because I didn't want you
to lose her again if I failed.</font>

293
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:26,606
<font face="Serif" size="18">But you can't blame the poor
girl for distrusting you.</font>

294
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:28,216
<font face="Serif" size="18">After all,</font>

295
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:33,308
<font face="Serif" size="18">you have been lying since you set
foot in the room, haven't you?</font>

296
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:41,142
<font face="Serif" size="18">- You escaped?
- We were trying to get back to you, Bug.</font>

297
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:42,622
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kira, look at me.</font>

298
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,712
<font face="Serif" size="18">I swear to you, it was
a Tablet of Reawakening.</font>

299
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:48,671
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was doing it for Mom, for all of us.
You have to trust me.</font>

300
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:51,848
<font face="Serif" size="18">You told me to trust you
when you left me.</font>

301
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,940
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kira, no, wait, wait!
Kira!</font>

302
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:58,554
<font face="Serif" size="18">Give her time,
give her time.</font>

303
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:01,510
<font face="Serif" size="18">She's had years to resent you
for your absence.</font>

304
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:04,121
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you've had years
to poison her against me.</font>

305
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:05,601
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, that is not true.</font>

306
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,212
<font face="Serif" size="18">We very rarely
spoke of you at all.</font>

307
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,302
<font face="Serif" size="18">Give him what he came for. The tablet?</font>

308
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,740
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't think
I will be returning it.</font>

309
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,960
<font face="Serif" size="18">Or your daughter,
for that matter.</font>

310
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,397
<font face="Serif" size="18">You bastard!</font>

311
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:27,144
<font face="Serif" size="18">And now you're in the floor!</font>

312
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:29,495
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, I hate to see that.</font>

313
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:33,281
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sofina really is a very,
very powerful wizard!</font>

314
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:37,241
<font face="Serif" size="18">You'd have thought that you'd have learned
that the last time she trapped you.</font>

315
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,549
<font face="Serif" size="18">You always wanted us
to get caught.</font>

316
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:44,771
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, I wanted you and Simon to get
caught, but he managed to escape somehow.</font>

317
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:48,644
<font face="Serif" size="18">All these years together, and you
double-cross us for this witch?</font>

318
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:51,038
<font face="Serif" size="18">Never put your trust
in a con man.</font>

319
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,213
<font face="Serif" size="18">Save for this...</font>

320
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,171
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kira really is happy</font>

321
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,695
<font face="Serif" size="18">and very well
taken care of here,</font>

322
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,698
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I have truly come
to love her as my own.</font>

323
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:03,006
<font face="Serif" size="18">I never actually saw the appeal of
being a father till I became one.</font>

324
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,706
<font face="Serif" size="18">But to have another person
look up to you</font>

325
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,665
<font face="Serif" size="18">and allow you to shape them
in your own image.</font>

326
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,711
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's a bit like a god!</font>

327
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:16,193
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, hang on, I'm a god and a lord.
I am really doing all right!</font>

328
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:17,673
<font face="Serif" size="18">Black wood?</font>

329
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,197
<font face="Serif" size="18">Could you possibly
return them to prison?</font>

330
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,069
<font face="Serif" size="18">And be sure
to collect the bounty.</font>

331
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:24,332
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, I must away.</font>

332
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,727
<font face="Serif" size="18">I am expecting two of the wealthiest
men from Baldur's Gate and Water deep</font>

333
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,991
<font face="Serif" size="18">to talk about the High
Sun Games, which are back!</font>

334
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:32,906
<font face="Serif" size="18">So there's something, isn't it?</font>

335
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,430
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was genuinely lovely
to see you both.</font>

336
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,825
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ah! Ah!</font>

337
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,609
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga! Holga! Holga!</font>

338
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,092
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kill both of them.</font>

339
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:53,796
<font face="Serif" size="18">We got to get her out
of there. We will.</font>

340
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,320
<font face="Serif" size="18">But we need to think
of our own hides right now.</font>

341
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,280
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Yeah, you got this, right?
- I know you don't.</font>

342
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:01,021
<font face="Serif" size="18">On your knees.</font>

343
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,201
<font face="Serif" size="18">Handsome blade.</font>

344
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:10,204
<font face="Serif" size="18">Is that the work
of Ghelryn Foehammer?</font>

345
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,031
<font face="Serif" size="18">How did you know?</font>

346
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,773
<font face="Serif" size="18">The inlay on the haft.</font>

347
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,645
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh.</font>

348
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,778
<font face="Serif" size="18">How's the weight? Does it parry?</font>

349
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,128
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's dark steel.</font>

350
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,477
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mmm. Very nice.</font>

351
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now put your heads down.</font>

352
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:27,090
<font face="Serif" size="18">Wait!</font>

353
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,744
<font face="Serif" size="18">What do you clean it with?</font>

354
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,965
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're about to lose your head.</font>

355
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,836
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is what
you're concerned with?</font>

356
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,535
<font face="Serif" size="18">If you wouldn't mind.</font>

357
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:41,757
<font face="Serif" size="18">Boiled linseed oil.
Once a month.</font>

358
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,934
<font face="Serif" size="18">Should be once a week. That's why
you're getting rust on the bit.</font>

359
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,764
<font face="Serif" size="18">Okay, chop it off. Chop
it off, let's do it.</font>

360
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,165
<font face="Serif" size="18">Get her!</font>

361
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,135
<font face="Serif" size="18">Stop her!</font>

362
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:18,359
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, we got 'em now!</font>

363
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,519
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Before we leave the city...
- Get boiled linseed oil, I know.</font>

364
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,615
<font face="Serif" size="18">Knock, knock.</font>

365
00:26:57,964 --> 00:27:00,357
<font face="Serif" size="18">I wanted to make sure
you were all right.</font>

366
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,711
<font face="Serif" size="18">I knew I'd see him again
one day.</font>

367
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,758
<font face="Serif" size="18">I just hoped
it would be different.</font>

368
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,500
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, you have
to understand that</font>

369
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,416
<font face="Serif" size="18">when he lost your mother,</font>

370
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,897
<font face="Serif" size="18">he sort of lost himself.</font>

371
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,989
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why did he lie about the tablet?</font>

372
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:27,994
<font face="Serif" size="18">Maybe he was ashamed to admit how
much he'd given up for so little.</font>

373
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:33,086
<font face="Serif" size="18">I should probably go
speak to him.</font>

374
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,438
<font face="Serif" size="18">What?</font>

375
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,745
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, he's gone, my dear.
He's gone.</font>

376
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,443
<font face="Serif" size="18">I gave him
the Tablet of Riches and...</font>

377
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,098
<font face="Serif" size="18">he left.</font>

378
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,930
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga, too?</font>

379
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,194
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm sorry.</font>

380
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,939
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I want you to know that
even if he isn't there for you,</font>

381
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:02,071
<font face="Serif" size="18">I always will be.</font>

382
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,857
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know.</font>

383
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:08,208
<font face="Serif" size="18">The fact that
you see good in me,</font>

384
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:11,124
<font face="Serif" size="18">makes me believe that there
might just be some in there.</font>

385
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,519
<font face="Serif" size="18">We could shoot an arrow
with a message into her room.</font>

386
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,480
<font face="Serif" size="18">What if it hits her? That
's a risk we're gonna have to take.</font>

387
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:23,005
<font face="Serif" size="18">Killing my daughter with
an arrow? No, it's not.</font>

388
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,226
<font face="Serif" size="18">Even if she got the message, she
wouldn't come. She thinks of...</font>

<font face="Serif" size="18">Forge as her dad.</font>

390
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:33,059
<font face="Serif" size="18">We have to get into that castle
and take her out ourselves.</font>

391
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,539
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's crazy, Ed.</font>

392
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,431
<font face="Serif" size="18">Castle Never's tighter than Korinn's Keep,
and you know what happened with that.</font>

393
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,457
<font face="Serif" size="18">We're gonna need a team.</font>

394
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,372
<font face="Serif" size="18">Team?
Who's gonna help us out?</font>

395
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:45,941
<font face="Serif" size="18">We have nothing
to pay them with. Yeah, but Forge does.</font>

396
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:48,615
<font face="Serif" size="18">He said the richest people were
coming to bet on the High Sun Games.</font>

in that vault.Yeah.</font>

398
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,383
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not to mention the tablet.</font>

399
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:54,820
<font face="Serif" size="18">And then Kira will know that...</font>

400
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,474
<font face="Serif" size="18">We abandoned her
for the right reason.</font>

401
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:02,610
<font face="Serif" size="18">I wouldn't put it like that,
but, uh, yeah. Yeah.</font>

402
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,004
<font face="Serif" size="18">Who do we get for this team?</font>

403
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:07,310
<font face="Serif" size="18">You know, I wonder
if Simon's still in Triboar.</font>

404
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,617
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon's a terrible sorcerer.</font>

405
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,446
<font face="Serif" size="18">We haven't seen him in two years.
I'm sure he's gotten better.</font>

406
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:17,103
<font face="Serif" size="18">No one can hold a candle
to this trick.</font>

407
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:24,414
<font face="Serif" size="18">How about this one? You people
like the smell of fresh-cut grass?</font>

408
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,160
<font face="Serif" size="18">Smell that?
It's fresh-cut grass.</font>

409
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,728
<font face="Serif" size="18">My five-year-old can
do that magic.</font>

410
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,774
<font face="Serif" size="18">But can he do this?</font>

411
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,300
<font face="Serif" size="18">Boo.</font>

412
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:42,171
<font face="Serif" size="18">He hasn't gotten better.</font>

413
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:44,347
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't think it's about
what he's doing up there.</font>

414
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,481
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is quite hard to be
slightly blurry like this, you know.</font>

415
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,092
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anyone can be very blurry,
but to be slightly blurry,</font>

416
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,790
<font face="Serif" size="18">that's the real magic.</font>

417
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,140
<font face="Serif" size="18">Is that...</font>

418
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,624
<font face="Serif" size="18">What? What was...</font>

419
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,192
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hey!</font>

420
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:05,238
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's nickin' our bits and bobs!</font>

421
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,457
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's not what you think.
It's all part of the act.</font>

422
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:08,763
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's lying.</font>

423
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,286
<font face="Serif" size="18">Get him!</font>

424
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:16,640
<font face="Serif" size="18">Shield spell!</font>

425
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,164
<font face="Serif" size="18">Shield spell!</font>

426
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,348
<font face="Serif" size="18">That wasn't a shield spell.</font>

427
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,931
<font face="Serif" size="18">I am not loving this show.</font>

428
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:50,936
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're a dead man!</font>

429
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,652
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Simon?
- Holga!</font>

430
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:14,133
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Staying for an encore?
- Get me out of here.</font>

431
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,929
<font face="Serif" size="18">I could've warned you
Forge was a prick.</font>

432
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:30,279
<font face="Serif" size="18">Soon as we left that vault,
Sofina tried to kill me</font>

433
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,107
<font face="Serif" size="18">and he just stood by.</font>

434
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,562
<font face="Serif" size="18">You know, there's rumors she
made Lord Neverember fall ill</font>

435
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,111
<font face="Serif" size="18">to clear the way for Forge.</font>

436
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:37,983
<font face="Serif" size="18">Her magic is
on a whole other level.</font>

437
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,637
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don't sell yourself short.
We saw your show.</font>

438
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,292
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, you can hit her with
that fresh-cut grass trick.</font>

439
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:44,946
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's funny.</font>

440
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,122
<font face="Serif" size="18">Look, I don't blame you
for wanting to save Kira,</font>

441
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:50,038
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I love the idea of
knocking Forge off his perch,</font>

442
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:52,127
<font face="Serif" size="18">but robbing Castle Never
isn't worth the risk.</font>

443
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,955
<font face="Serif" size="18">And robbing your audience is?</font>

444
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,264
<font face="Serif" size="18">How broke are you? Desperately.</font>

445
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,614
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was planning on sleeping
in the theater tonight,</font>

446
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:03,051
<font face="Serif" size="18">but now that seems imprudent. So?</font>

447
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:06,141
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do we even know what sort of arcane
magic is protecting the vault?</font>

448
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:07,708
<font face="Serif" size="18">We're gonna find out! How?</font>

449
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,971
<font face="Serif" size="18">You gonna sneak past
the entire Castle Watch?</font>

450
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:13,105
<font face="Serif" size="18">Me? No.
A druid maybe, a Wild Shape.</font>

451
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,846
<font face="Serif" size="18">They could get in and out
undetected as a...</font>

452
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:18,675
<font face="Serif" size="18">As a mouse or a... A deer.</font>

453
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,809
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes, a deer! It'll blend in with
all the other deer in the castle.</font>

454
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,028
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don't mock me.</font>

455
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">Where can we find a druid?</font>

456
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,642
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know a druid. Doric.</font>

457
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,861
<font face="Serif" size="18">She's truly one of a kind.</font>

458
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,299
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sounds romantic in nature.</font>

459
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,431
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah. For me it was.</font>

460
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:39,696
<font face="Serif" size="18">She, however, found my lack
of self-esteem unattractive.</font>

461
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,394
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not your best trait.</font>

462
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:42,743
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you.</font>

463
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,922
<font face="Serif" size="18">In the name
of Forge Fitzwilliam,</font>

464
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:52,796
<font face="Serif" size="18">the prisoner is hereby sentenced
to death by dismemberment,</font>

465
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,887
<font face="Serif" size="18">for the crime of speaking ill
of our leader.</font>

466
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,673
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Emerald Enclave
will never relent!</font>

467
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,588
<font face="Serif" size="18">Justice cannot be killed!</font>

468
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,372
<font face="Serif" size="18">On my command.</font>

469
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,437
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your Doric's a bit of a
radical. Ready?</font>

470
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:06,593
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, no, that's not Doric.</font>

471
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,726
<font face="Serif" size="18">Move in!</font>

472
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,989
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kill her!</font>

473
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,041
<font face="Serif" size="18">Move in!</font>

474
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:22,696
<font face="Serif" size="18">Move in!</font>

475
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,132
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's her.</font>

476
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:40,018
<font face="Serif" size="18">What is that again? It's an owlbear.</font>

477
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:16,315
<font face="Serif" size="18">- How high is this place?
- It's just up here.</font>

478
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:19,013
<font face="Serif" size="18">Stay where you are! Wait! Wait! It's me!</font>

479
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:21,668
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon. Simon who?</font>

480
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:22,886
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ouch.</font>

481
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,368
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon Aumar. Sorcerer.</font>

482
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,414
<font face="Serif" size="18">I courted you.</font>

483
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,851
<font face="Serif" size="18">You said I made you feel sad.</font>

484
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,897
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not from anything I did,
just from who I was.</font>

485
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,421
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh.</font>

486
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,250
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

487
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,903
<font face="Serif" size="18">What are you doing here?</font>

488
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,297
<font face="Serif" size="18">We need a deer. We don't need a deer.</font>

489
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,386
<font face="Serif" size="18">We're gonna take down
Forge Fitzwilliam.</font>

490
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,220
<font face="Serif" size="18">So, how'd you come to live here?</font>

491
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:55,702
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was born to humans who decided
they didn't want a tie fling child.</font>

492
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:58,139
<font face="Serif" size="18">Uh-huh. The wood elves took me in.</font>

493
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,141
<font face="Serif" size="18">I joined the Emerald Enclave
to protect them.</font>

494
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:01,882
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's all the more reason
to join us.</font>

495
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:04,493
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're the only one who can
get into that castle unseen</font>

496
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,191
<font face="Serif" size="18">and tell us what
we're dealing with.</font>

497
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,889
<font face="Serif" size="18">As you can imagine,
I don't trust humans.</font>

498
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:11,457
<font face="Serif" size="18">I find you to be
hateful and selfish.</font>

499
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,503
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, I'm finding you to be
a little mean.</font>

500
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,505
<font face="Serif" size="18">If it helps,
I'm only half-human.</font>

501
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,941
<font face="Serif" size="18">But you're a bad sorcerer.</font>

502
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,292
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, Simon...
He's a mighty sorcerer!</font>

503
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:23,077
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's a descendant
of Elminster Aumar.</font>

504
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:27,212
<font face="Serif" size="18">The only way to succeed in this is to
have confidence that it can be done.</font>

505
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,649
<font face="Serif" size="18">He doesn't.Yeah, I suppose that's fair.</font>

506
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:33,914
<font face="Serif" size="18">Look, Simon may not have my wit
or Holga's strength,</font>

507
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,177
<font face="Serif" size="18">but when it counts,
this young man delivers.</font>

508
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:39,180
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's why I chose him. He's
also the only sorcerer you know.</font>

509
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:40,703
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga, not helpful.</font>

510
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:43,402
<font face="Serif" size="18">What is it exactly
that you bring to this?</font>

511
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:48,015
<font face="Serif" size="18">Me? I'm a planner. You know?
I make plans.</font>

512
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,236
<font face="Serif" size="18">You've already made the plan,
so what value do you have now?</font>

513
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:56,937
<font face="Serif" size="18">If, uh, the plan fails... the
existing plan... I make a new plan.</font>

514
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:58,460
<font face="Serif" size="18">So you make plans that fail.</font>

515
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,070
<font face="Serif" size="18">No.He also plays the lute.</font>

516
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:03,117
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga, not relevant.
Trust me, I'm indispensable.</font>

517
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:08,557
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well,</font>

518
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:11,908
<font face="Serif" size="18">none of the plans we've tried
to take down Forge have worked.</font>

519
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,782
<font face="Serif" size="18">We dared to question
how he came to power,</font>

520
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,697
<font face="Serif" size="18">so he declared us enemies.</font>

521
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,570
<font face="Serif" size="18">Began destroying our homes</font>

522
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,920
<font face="Serif" size="18">and executing our people.</font>

523
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,533
<font face="Serif" size="18">If we don't stop Forge soon,</font>

524
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,231
<font face="Serif" size="18">there'll be nothing left
to defend.</font>

525
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,149
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm not doing this
for the money.</font>

526
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:39,806
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm doing this for the people who
took me in when no one else would.</font>

527
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,678
<font face="Serif" size="18">So we'll keep your share then.</font>

528
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:50,556
<font face="Serif" size="18">I sense your impatience.</font>

529
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:53,472
<font face="Serif" size="18">Szass Tam.</font>

530
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:58,694
<font face="Serif" size="18">But you have always been
the disciple I rely on most.</font>

531
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,394
<font face="Serif" size="18">Doff your cowl.</font>

532
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,526
<font face="Serif" size="18">You needn't hide your sigils
from me.</font>

533
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,139
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'd rather be flensed and flayed</font>

534
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:12,186
<font face="Serif" size="18">than spend another hour
with Forge Fitzwilliam.</font>

535
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,233
<font face="Serif" size="18">The man is insufferable.</font>

536
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:21,369
<font face="Serif" size="18">But we never would have come
this far without his 'charm.'</font>

537
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:26,156
<font face="Serif" size="18">The living have befouled
this world long enough.</font>

538
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:31,684
<font face="Serif" size="18">Take solace in knowing that your
work here is nearly complete.</font>

539
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:35,557
<font face="Serif" size="18">There you are!</font>

540
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,431
<font face="Serif" size="18">With your hood off, I notice.</font>

541
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,521
<font face="Serif" size="18">Probably best to keep that on.</font>

542
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:45,045
<font face="Serif" size="18">You know,
you Red Wizards of Thay</font>

543
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:48,353
<font face="Serif" size="18">are not as popular as you
should be outside Thay.</font>

544
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:52,270
<font face="Serif" size="18">And, of course, you're about
to be considerably less popular.</font>

545
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:58,580
<font face="Serif" size="18">But far, far be it from me ever
to tell you what to do.</font>

546
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:00,365
<font face="Serif" size="18">Caldwell and Piradost
have arrived.</font>

547
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,932
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was gonna give them...</font>

548
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:05,935
<font face="Serif" size="18">Awful, isn't it? I really have to
do something about these chairs.</font>

549
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,633
<font face="Serif" size="18">They're, uh...</font>

550
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,594
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, I think you will find that we
have taken every imaginable measure</font>

551
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:15,031
<font face="Serif" size="18">to protect the assets
that you may... or may not...</font>

552
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,730
<font face="Serif" size="18">Choose to wager
during the High Sun Games.</font>

553
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:21,124
<font face="Serif" size="18">We have new portcullises
on every wing of the castle.</font>

554
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,865
<font face="Serif" size="18">If the alarm is raised,</font>

555
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,216
<font face="Serif" size="18">nobody gets in or out.</font>

556
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,743
<font face="Serif" size="18">And then there is...</font>

557
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,875
<font face="Serif" size="18">the vault itself.</font>

558
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:37,532
<font face="Serif" size="18">My chief adviser, Sofina,
can give you all the details.</font>

559
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,799
<font face="Serif" size="18">It is protected by
the Arcane Seal of Mordenkainen.</font>

560
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:51,546
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, uh...</font>

561
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,376
<font face="Serif" size="18">Perhaps not
all the details, but, uh,</font>

562
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,379
<font face="Serif" size="18">suffice to say it is
a seriously powerful spell.</font>

563
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:01,469
<font face="Serif" size="18">Might I inquire, what prompted
you to resume the games?</font>

564
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:03,906
<font face="Serif" size="18">Lord Neverember considered
them quite brutal.</font>

565
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,126
<font face="Serif" size="18">Lord Neverember and I are
very different men.</font>

566
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,302
<font face="Serif" size="18">For example, I prefer
to be up and about.</font>

567
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,348
<font face="Serif" size="18">He prefers to be
in a vegetative state.</font>

568
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,438
<font face="Serif" size="18">You are terrible.</font>

569
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,354
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can be naughty. No, I...</font>

570
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:19,705
<font face="Serif" size="18">The truth is that the games bring
the city together like nothing else.</font>

571
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:25,624
<font face="Serif" size="18">And it is not the role of government
to deny the people what they crave.</font>

572
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:29,889
<font face="Serif" size="18">Or to deny you rich bastards
the right to profit off them.</font>

573
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,154
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now who wants refreshments?</font>

574
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:35,634
<font face="Serif" size="18">Silence!</font>

575
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,204
<font face="Serif" size="18">A Wild Shape is among us.</font>

576
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,104
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hey!</font>

577
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,540
<font face="Serif" size="18">Stop!</font>

578
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,419
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can't grab her!</font>

579
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:18,057
<font face="Serif" size="18">So she did become a deer.</font>

580
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:19,885
<font face="Serif" size="18">Only at the very end.</font>

581
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:22,714
<font face="Serif" size="18">Are you absolutely sure
about Sofina? I saw her markings.</font>

582
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:24,846
<font face="Serif" size="18">No wonder I couldn't counter
her Time Stop.</font>

583
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,110
<font face="Serif" size="18">Forge knew all along. He's got my
daughter in there with a Red Wizard.</font>

584
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:32,375
<font face="Serif" size="18">The vault is protected by something
called 'Morty Kamen's Arcane Seal.'</font>

585
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,768
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mordenkainen?</font>

586
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:36,162
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, that's it. Oh, pity.</font>

587
00:42:36,336 --> 00:42:38,338
<font face="Serif" size="18">What? If the vault has
Mordenkainen's Seal,</font>

588
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:40,072
<font face="Serif" size="18">we're not getting in.
It's impenetrable.</font>

589
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:41,733
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can't you just open it
with magic?</font>

590
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:43,778
<font face="Serif" size="18">Okay, here we go.</font>

591
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:47,216
<font face="Serif" size="18">I hate how everyone thinks that you
can solve any problem with magic.</font>

592
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,350
<font face="Serif" size="18">There are limits.
This isn't some bedtime story.</font>

593
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:53,309
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is the real world. So
there's no way to open it?</font>

594
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:57,531
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, I mean, if I were one of the
world's most powerful sorcerers, so, no.</font>

595
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,402
<font face="Serif" size="18">Or if we had
the Helm of Disjunction.</font>

596
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:01,491
<font face="Serif" size="18">The what?</font>

597
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,706
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's a helmet that disables
all nearby enchantments.</font>

598
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:06,496
<font face="Serif" size="18">But it doesn't matter. The thing
went missing ages ago. We're done.</font>

599
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,890
<font face="Serif" size="18">Huh? Come on.</font>

600
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:11,893
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's the problem?
We can find that helmet.</font>

601
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:15,505
<font face="Serif" size="18">Even if we did, I couldn't use it without
attuning to it, which I'm terrible at.</font>

602
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,551
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can do it.
I know you can.</font>

603
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:20,225
<font face="Serif" size="18">You saying that doesn't make it so.
Yeah, but you saying it does.</font>

604
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:21,468
<font face="Serif" size="18">But I can't.But you can.</font>

605
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:22,730
<font face="Serif" size="18">But I won't.Just say it.</font>

606
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:23,992
<font face="Serif" size="18">No! Fine.</font>

607
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,864
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can we just keep this
between us?</font>

608
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:28,867
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't want to hurt
the group's morale. What morale?</font>

609
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,479
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga knows where the helmet is. You do?</font>

610
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:35,656
<font face="Serif" size="18">My tribe fought the Cult of the
Dragon over it at the Evermoors.</font>

611
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,615
<font face="Serif" size="18">We could just ask them
where it went.</font>

612
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,965
<font face="Serif" size="18">That battle was a century ago.
They're all dead.</font>

613
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:42,097
<font face="Serif" size="18">So? Ask them with magic.</font>

614
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:44,902
<font face="Serif" size="18">He just made a whole speech how he
can't fix everything with magic.</font>

615
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:46,406
<font face="Serif" size="18">Actually,
that is something I can do.</font>

616
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,148
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can bring back the dead?</font>

617
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,280
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can't, uh, bring them back,</font>

618
00:43:51,454 --> 00:43:54,153
<font face="Serif" size="18">but I have this token that lets
me ask corpses some questions,</font>

619
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:55,807
<font face="Serif" size="18">and then they go back
to being dead.</font>

620
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:58,070
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yuck. Yeah, it's fairly horrible.</font>

621
00:43:58,244 --> 00:44:00,507
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's fairly wonderful.</font>

622
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:04,076
<font face="Serif" size="18">We're off to the Evermoors.
Thank you, Simon, for the drinks.</font>

623
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,599
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, what? No...</font>

624
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,732
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just pay it with magic.</font>

625
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:30,537
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Wild Shape must be in
league with Forge's former partners.</font>

626
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:33,148
<font face="Serif" size="18">Perhaps Forge is
working against us?</font>

627
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:35,324
<font face="Serif" size="18">As long as he profits,</font>

628
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:37,892
<font face="Serif" size="18">he will not interfere
with Szass Tam's conquest.</font>

629
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,894
<font face="Serif" size="18">I will find these thieves.</font>

630
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:41,853
<font face="Serif" size="18">Before you go,</font>

631
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:45,073
<font face="Serif" size="18">the men behind us
allowed them to escape.</font>

632
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,901
<font face="Serif" size="18">Understood.</font>

633
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,252
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's a Thayan!</font>

634
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:15,713
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hey, Ed.</font>

635
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:18,585
<font face="Serif" size="18">Huh? Look where we are.</font>

636
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:21,109
<font face="Serif" size="18">Marlamin? Really?</font>

637
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:23,155
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why would you do that
to yourself?</font>

638
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:25,548
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm just gonna pick up
some of my things.</font>

639
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:32,773
<font face="Serif" size="18">He painted the shutters.</font>

640
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:34,557
<font face="Serif" size="18">Pretty.</font>

641
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:44,045
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga!</font>

642
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:45,873
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hello, Marlamin.</font>

643
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:48,267
<font face="Serif" size="18">- That's Marlamin?
- Oh, yeah.</font>

644
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:51,531
<font face="Serif" size="18">We were all a little surprised
the first time we met him.</font>

645
00:45:52,488 --> 00:45:54,577
<font face="Serif" size="18">I thought your sentence
was longer.</font>

646
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,275
<font face="Serif" size="18">I busted out of there.</font>

647
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:01,236
<font face="Serif" size="18">Same old Holga.</font>

648
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:05,153
<font face="Serif" size="18">So what have you been up to?</font>

649
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,068
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh.</font>

650
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:08,678
<font face="Serif" size="18">The usual.</font>

651
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:11,159
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've got my garden.
I'm working on my book.</font>

652
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:14,032
<font face="Serif" size="18">I see you still have that
walking stick I gave you.</font>

653
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:16,643
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

654
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:18,906
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, you can take it with you
if you want.</font>

655
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,952
<font face="Serif" size="18">Gwinn's not much for rambling. Gwinn?</font>

656
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,799
<font face="Serif" size="18">You home, darling? In here.</font>

657
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:26,218
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh! Squashed a pack
of bullywugs down at the...</font>

658
00:46:26,392 --> 00:46:27,785
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh. Hello.</font>

659
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:30,309
<font face="Serif" size="18">Who's this, then? Oh, Gwinn, this is Holga.</font>

660
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:32,224
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh.</font>

661
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,139
<font face="Serif" size="18">Heard a lot about you.</font>

662
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,097
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'd shake your hand,
but, uh...</font>

663
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:37,271
<font face="Serif" size="18">Pleasure.</font>

664
00:46:37,316 --> 00:46:39,057
<font face="Serif" size="18">How long you in town for?</font>

665
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:40,667
<font face="Serif" size="18">Um, just passing through.</font>

666
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,148
<font face="Serif" size="18">Gonna talk to some corpses
south of Nesmé.</font>

667
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:44,802
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh. Great, yeah.</font>

668
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,067
<font face="Serif" size="18">Gonna get washed up for supper.
What we having?</font>

669
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,286
<font face="Serif" size="18">I cured a goose and I
gathered some pickleberries.</font>

670
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,635
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mmm.</font>

671
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,681
<font face="Serif" size="18">Nice meeting you, Holga.Yeah.</font>

672
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:01,514
<font face="Serif" size="18">So how long have you two...
Going on a year.</font>

673
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,995
<font face="Serif" size="18">Does she make you happy?</font>

674
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:05,692
<font face="Serif" size="18">Happier than I did?</font>

675
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,914
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, I'll put it this way:
She makes her living honestly.</font>

676
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:12,568
<font face="Serif" size="18">She doesn't drink herself silly.</font>

677
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,486
<font face="Serif" size="18">And she doesn't make me weep
in the small hours,</font>

678
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,358
<font face="Serif" size="18">wondering where she is.</font>

679
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:21,055
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was in pain.</font>

680
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:23,797
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was banished from my
damn tribe to be with you.</font>

681
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,974
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I tried to build us a home
so you could forget that.</font>

682
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:30,717
<font face="Serif" size="18">But you never could.</font>

683
00:47:34,068 --> 00:47:35,809
<font face="Serif" size="18">Gwinn seems lovely.</font>

684
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,159
<font face="Serif" size="18">You deserve that.</font>

685
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,552
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you.</font>

686
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:43,382
<font face="Serif" size="18">You know, when you left,
I lost my family.</font>

687
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:48,039
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've been fortunate enough
to find another.</font>

688
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:52,652
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I wish nothing less
than that for you.</font>

689
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:58,136
<font face="Serif" size="18">My sweet, old Ho-Ho.</font>

690
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,240
<font face="Serif" size="18">We're gonna take down Forge.</font>

691
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:20,245
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm gonna show Marlamin and the Elk
tribe they were fools to let me go.</font>

692
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:43,154
<font face="Serif" size="18">So many of my kin gave
their lives in battle here.</font>

693
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:48,681
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'd always imagined I'd be buried
in sacred ground like this.</font>

694
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:49,899
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah.</font>

695
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:52,293
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anyone got a shovel?</font>

696
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:01,085
<font face="Serif" size="18">Okay, Simon, how does this work?</font>

697
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:04,001
<font face="Serif" size="18">I read the incantation
on this cleric's token.</font>

698
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:05,480
<font face="Serif" size="18">Should be here somewhere.</font>

699
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,613
<font face="Serif" size="18">Here!</font>

700
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:11,182
<font face="Serif" size="18">All right. Once the dead man is
revived, we can ask him five questions,</font>

701
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:14,315
<font face="Serif" size="18">at which point he will die
again, never to be re-revived.</font>

702
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:16,274
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why five questions?</font>

703
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:18,121
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't know,
that's just how it works. Seems arbitrary.</font>

704
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:20,800
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can we get on with this, please?
Right, yes.</font>

705
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:30,331
<font face="Serif" size="18">Delightful.</font>

706
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,345
<font face="Serif" size="18">Maybe I'm not saying it right.</font>

707
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:50,264
<font face="Serif" size="18">I wasn't scared,
merely startled.</font>

708
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:53,441
<font face="Serif" size="18">Here we go.</font>

709
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:56,923
<font face="Serif" size="18">Were you killed in
the Battle of the Evermoors?</font>

710
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,968
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes. Great!</font>

711
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:02,842
<font face="Serif" size="18">I mean, not for you.
Sorry for your loss.</font>

712
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:04,800
<font face="Serif" size="18">Four more questions, right?</font>

713
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,106
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes.</font>

714
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,629
<font face="Serif" size="18">No. No, no,
that wasn't for you.</font>

715
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:08,963
<font face="Serif" size="18">Did that count as a question?</font>

716
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,111
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Yes.
- Damn it.</font>

717
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,680
<font face="Serif" size="18">Only answer when
I talk to you, okay?</font>

718
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:17,509
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes. Why did you say 'okay?'
at the end of that?</font>

719
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:19,076
<font face="Serif" size="18">I didn't.</font>

720
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:21,861
<font face="Serif" size="18">Fantastic. Where's the shovel?</font>

721
00:51:29,738 --> 00:51:31,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">Toke Horgath.</font>

722
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:35,831
<font face="Serif" size="18">During the battle, did you see
the Helmet of Disjunction?</font>

723
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:40,140
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was in possession of my
chief, Stan hard Grimwulf.</font>

724
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:42,011
<font face="Serif" size="18">Okay, good.</font>

725
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,188
<font face="Serif" size="18">And what did
Stan hard Grimwulf do with it?</font>

726
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:50,629
<font face="Serif" size="18">As the cultists breached the
ridge, we knew we outnumbered them.</font>

727
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:55,416
<font face="Serif" size="18">But our advantage meant nothing
against the dragon Rakor.</font>

728
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,123
<font face="Serif" size="18">Horgath!</font>

729
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:07,994
<font face="Serif" size="18">Horgath!</font>

730
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,084
<font face="Serif" size="18">Take this and run.</font>

731
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:13,869
<font face="Serif" size="18">Keep it from Rakor at all costs!</font>

732
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,654
<font face="Serif" size="18">Understood, sir.
Don't worry.</font>

733
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:18,135
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's the last thing
I remember.</font>

734
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:24,141
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh. Yeah, well...</font>

735
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,578
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thanks for your help.</font>

736
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:28,928
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let's go look
for Stan hard Grimwulf's grave.</font>

737
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:30,712
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hang on! Hang on! Hmm?</font>

738
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,908
<font face="Serif" size="18">Aren't you going to ask him
the last three questions?</font>

739
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:34,997
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ask him what? He already
told us everything he knows.</font>

740
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:37,581
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, you can't just leave him like that.
Look at the poor bloke.</font>

741
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,461
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, fine.</font>

742
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:42,811
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's your favorite food?</font>

743
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:45,640
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oats. No, barley!</font>

744
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:47,207
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, boy.</font>

745
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:49,514
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do you like cats?</font>

746
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:50,950
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not really.</font>

747
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:52,169
<font face="Serif" size="18">Okay.</font>

748
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:53,909
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's two plus two?</font>

749
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,389
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm bad at math.</font>

750
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:57,348
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don't you feel better? No.</font>

751
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,482
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oftentimes,</font>

752
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:04,050
<font face="Serif" size="18">the most onerous decision
a leader can take</font>

753
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,965
<font face="Serif" size="18">is when to retreat.</font>

754
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:08,663
<font face="Serif" size="18">I issued the order.</font>

755
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:13,625
<font face="Serif" size="18">I commanded my battle lord
to deliver the helmet</font>

756
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:16,062
<font face="Serif" size="18">to our swiftest rider,
Ven Salafin.</font>

757
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:18,369
<font face="Serif" size="18">If we can just make it
over the ridge, we can...</font>

758
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:21,154
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not again.</font>

759
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:25,158
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was the morning
of the battle.</font>

760
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:30,294
<font face="Serif" size="18">As I stepped out my bath,
my foot slipped on the stone.</font>

761
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,169
<font face="Serif" size="18">And then you went into
the battle?</font>

762
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:39,738
<font face="Serif" size="18">No. I died. From the fall.</font>

763
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:42,784
<font face="Serif" size="18">But Stan hard Grimwulf said he
gave the helmet to Ven Salafin.</font>

764
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:44,786
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's you, isn't it?</font>

765
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,137
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm Sven Salafin.
Ven's my brother.</font>

766
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,575
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is a nightmare.</font>

767
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:52,011
<font face="Serif" size="18">Is Ven all right?</font>

768
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:57,059
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was wounded
and had lost my horse</font>

769
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,844
<font face="Serif" size="18">as I escaped
the field of battle.</font>

770
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:01,412
<font face="Serif" size="18">I didn't care about myself.</font>

771
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:03,805
<font face="Serif" size="18">I just needed
to keep the helmet safe.</font>

772
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:17,254
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was a Thayan,
who bore the mark of Szass Tam.</font>

773
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,389
<font face="Serif" size="18">I waited for the killing blow.</font>

774
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:24,478
<font face="Serif" size="18">But it never came.</font>

775
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,481
<font face="Serif" size="18">He had a kind way.</font>

776
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:30,179
<font face="Serif" size="18">He told me
his name was Xenk Yendar.</font>

777
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:33,487
<font face="Serif" size="18">He had fled Szass Tam
and now lived in exile.</font>

778
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:37,448
<font face="Serif" size="18">As I died, he promised
to keep the helmet safe.</font>

779
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:39,580
<font face="Serif" size="18">And for some reason,
I believed him.</font>

780
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:41,974
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're joking.
A 'kind' Thayan?</font>

781
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:43,148
<font face="Serif" size="18">I speak truth.</font>

782
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:44,672
<font face="Serif" size="18">You speak horseshit.</font>

783
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:47,022
<font face="Serif" size="18">That Thayan lied
and you died for nothing.</font>

784
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:49,996
<font face="Serif" size="18">The helmet's a dead end. We'll have
to find another way into the vault.</font>

785
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,071
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, I've heard of Xenk.</font>

786
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:54,615
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's a paladin. He helped the
Enclave defeat the Clerics of Talos.</font>

787
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:55,814
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know the name as well.</font>

788
00:54:55,988 --> 00:54:57,548
<font face="Serif" size="18">My uncle said Xenk
fended off a Beholder</font>

789
00:54:57,642 --> 00:54:59,165
<font face="Serif" size="18">using only a sharpened gourd.</font>

790
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,994
<font face="Serif" size="18">A sharpened gourd? Something sharp.</font>

791
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:05,345
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Thayans are murderers.
End of story.</font>

792
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:08,348
<font face="Serif" size="18">What?</font>

793
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,437
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've heard of him, too.No.</font>

794
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:13,310
<font face="Serif" size="18">He fought with my cousin in the Anauroch.
He says he's a good man.</font>

795
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:17,226
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, you can all go find this lovely
Xenk and braid each other's hair.</font>

796
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:18,750
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'll find another way.</font>

797
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,929
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's his problem? He's got a history
with the Thayans.</font>

798
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:28,325
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know how you're feeling.
But we're running out of time.</font>

799
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,764
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'd be betraying Zia.</font>

800
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:36,507
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, you wouldn't. You'd be
doing it to save her and Kira.</font>

801
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:39,161
<font face="Serif" size="18">Look, if Xenk turns out
to be a prick,</font>

802
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,207
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'll split him
right down the middle.</font>

803
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,645
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's very sweet. What
have we got to lose?</font>

804
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:50,521
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anyone know where
stupid Xenk is?</font>

805
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,480
<font face="Serif" size="18">Last I heard, he was working with
the Harpers in Mornbryn's Shield.</font>

806
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,482
<font face="Serif" size="18">Great! Harpers.</font>

807
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,310
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's his problem with Harpers?</font>

808
00:55:57,484 --> 00:55:59,007
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's got a history
with them too.</font>

809
00:55:59,181 --> 00:56:00,531
<font face="Serif" size="18">All right, let's go.</font>

810
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:02,663
<font face="Serif" size="18">Excuse me?</font>

811
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:05,405
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm still alive.</font>

812
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,189
<font face="Serif" size="18">Right. Um...</font>

813
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:10,192
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's your favorite book?</font>

814
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,194
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mmm, hard to pick just one.</font>

815
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:14,545
<font face="Serif" size="18">Fifth question, right? Yep.</font>

816
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,677
<font face="Serif" size="18">Good. In terms of historical works,</font>

817
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:20,638
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'd say The Fanged Tome
of Lykanthus Szar.</font>

818
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:24,250
<font face="Serif" size="18">That was only
the fourth question.</font>

819
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:26,078
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hello?</font>

820
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:28,689
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, shit.</font>

821
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:33,346
<font face="Serif" size="18">Heave! Heave!</font>

822
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,130
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on,
we need more! Come on!</font>

823
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,905
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's alive!</font>

824
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,213
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you!</font>

825
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:16,258
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you, sir.</font>

826
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:29,402
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's interesting. I' ve
seen more interesting.</font>

827
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:31,448
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ed, go talk to him. You go talk to him.</font>

828
00:57:31,622 --> 00:57:33,382
<font face="Serif" size="18">You know,
I've pulled cats out of fish.</font>

829
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,111
<font face="Serif" size="18">Xenk, is it?</font>

830
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,550
<font face="Serif" size="18">That is a query
I prefer not to answer</font>

831
00:57:46,593 --> 00:57:48,247
<font face="Serif" size="18">without knowing
to whom I am speaking.</font>

832
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:49,901
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm Holga Kilgore.</font>

833
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:53,165
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is Simon, Edgin
and Doric back there.</font>

834
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:57,386
<font face="Serif" size="18">And what brings you
to Mornbryn's Shield? You do.</font>

835
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,693
<font face="Serif" size="18">We're trying to find
the Helmet of Dysfunction.</font>

836
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:01,478
<font face="Serif" size="18">Disjunction.</font>

837
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:03,480
<font face="Serif" size="18">Many lives were lost
in defense of that helm.</font>

838
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:06,047
<font face="Serif" size="18">To speak of it would be
to diminish their sacrifice.</font>

839
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:11,139
<font face="Serif" size="18">Janklee.</font>

840
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:14,752
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jankleeto you as well, good sir.</font>

841
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:21,846
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're known as a man
of honor and integrity,</font>

842
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:26,154
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I can assure you, our reasons for
wanting the helmet are entirely noble.</font>

843
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:27,808
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yep.
We're gonna rob someone.</font>

844
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,375
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga!</font>

845
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:32,117
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not just anyone.
Forge Fitzwilliam.</font>

846
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,380
<font face="Serif" size="18">And the Red Wizard of Thay
he's partnered with.</font>

847
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:37,601
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come with me.</font>

848
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:43,781
<font face="Serif" size="18">What is this place?</font>

849
00:58:43,955 --> 00:58:46,348
<font face="Serif" size="18">A Harper sanctuary.</font>

850
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,655
<font face="Serif" size="18">But surely your friend Edgin
already knew that.</font>

851
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:51,702
<font face="Serif" size="18">How'd you know I was a Harper?</font>

852
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:54,226
<font face="Serif" size="18">You may have forsworn your oath,</font>

853
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,577
<font face="Serif" size="18">but your oath
hasn't forsworn you.</font>

854
00:58:57,751 --> 00:59:01,755
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just because that sentence is
symmetrical doesn't make it not nonsense.</font>

855
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:03,757
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why do you wish
to rob Fitzwilliam?</font>

856
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:06,586
<font face="Serif" size="18">He stole Edgin's daughter and a
great deal of treasure from us.</font>

857
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,066
<font face="Serif" size="18">Also a Tablet of Reawakening.</font>

858
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,894
<font face="Serif" size="18">He doesn't need to know
all that.</font>

859
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:11,417
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was just...</font>

860
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,462
<font face="Serif" size="18">In other words,
Forge is a real son of a bitch.</font>

861
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,639
<font face="Serif" size="18">So you blame his mother
for his corruption.</font>

862
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,075
<font face="Serif" size="18">What?</font>

863
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:18,772
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, it's an expression.</font>

864
00:59:18,946 --> 00:59:20,557
<font face="Serif" size="18">I see.</font>

865
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:22,776
<font face="Serif" size="18">I do not traffic
in colloquialisms.</font>

866
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:25,518
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're not a lot of fun,
are you?</font>

867
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,912
<font face="Serif" size="18">If Fitzwilliam is truly
allied with a Red Wizard,</font>

868
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:31,611
<font face="Serif" size="18">their intentions must go
beyond the mere political.</font>

869
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:34,048
<font face="Serif" size="18">Over a century ago,
the necromancer Szass Tam</font>

870
00:59:34,222 --> 00:59:36,877
<font face="Serif" size="18">was one of eight zulkirs
who ruled the nation of Thay.</font>

871
00:59:37,051 --> 00:59:38,313
<font face="Serif" size="18">Great, a history lesson.</font>

872
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:40,577
<font face="Serif" size="18">But Tam's hunger for power
was absolute.</font>

873
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,015
<font face="Serif" size="18">On the eve of the solstice,</font>

874
00:59:44,189 --> 00:59:47,192
<font face="Serif" size="18">residents of the capital gathered
for a celebration.</font>

875
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:56,114
<font face="Serif" size="18">Unbeknownst to them,
or his fellow rulers,</font>

876
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,159
<font face="Serif" size="18">Tam had a plan of his own:</font>

877
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:01,510
<font face="Serif" size="18">To stage an unholy coup.</font>

878
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:30,191
<font face="Serif" size="18">He unleashed
the Beckoning Death,</font>

879
01:00:30,365 --> 01:00:33,891
<font face="Serif" size="18">a spell that would consume the
souls of all who beheld it,</font>

880
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:36,763
<font face="Serif" size="18">enslaving them to his will.</font>

881
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:38,809
<font face="Serif" size="18">With the aid of his Red Wizards,</font>

882
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:41,986
<font face="Serif" size="18">Szass Tam created an army
of the undead,</font>

883
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,337
<font face="Serif" size="18">allowing him to conquer
the entire nation.</font>

884
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:51,822
<font face="Serif" size="18">Szass's power extends no further
than the borders of Thay.</font>

885
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:54,041
<font face="Serif" size="18">I suspect he and his Red Wizards
will not be content</font>

886
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:57,218
<font face="Serif" size="18">until they have infected the whole
of Faerûn with their maleficence.</font>

887
01:00:57,392 --> 01:00:59,917
<font face="Serif" size="18">You done? Because we already
know that Red Wizards are bad.</font>

888
01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:01,658
<font face="Serif" size="18">And so does Forge.</font>

889
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:03,592
<font face="Serif" size="18">The question remains, if they
helped him to take power,</font>

890
01:01:03,616 --> 01:01:04,791
<font face="Serif" size="18">what do they stand to gain?</font>

891
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,880
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sounds like we have
a common enemy.</font>

892
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:08,934
<font face="Serif" size="18">You give us that helmet,
and we take Forge down.</font>

893
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,015
<font face="Serif" size="18">No one stays Lord without
a fortune to back him up.</font>

894
01:01:11,189 --> 01:01:12,886
<font face="Serif" size="18">And the Red Wizards
lose their puppet.</font>

895
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,193
<font face="Serif" size="18">What will become
of the wealth you burgle?</font>

896
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:17,151
<font face="Serif" size="18">What does that matter?</font>

897
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,806
<font face="Serif" size="18">I will not be complicit in the
illicit use of ill-gotten booty.</font>

898
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,158
<font face="Serif" size="18">Uh... Fine. We'll divide it
amongst the townspeople.</font>

899
01:01:24,332 --> 01:01:26,421
<font face="Serif" size="18">Swear to it. What?</font>

900
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:28,380
<font face="Serif" size="18">Place your hand
on this Harper's Seal</font>

901
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:31,688
<font face="Serif" size="18">and swear that you will indeed
distribute all the wealth you take</font>

902
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:33,777
<font face="Serif" size="18">amongst the people
of Never winter.</font>

903
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:36,388
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sure, fine.</font>

904
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:41,610
<font face="Serif" size="18">Go on, Ed.</font>

905
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:44,309
<font face="Serif" size="18">Promise you'll give
Forge's money to the people.</font>

906
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:51,751
<font face="Serif" size="18">Promise I'll...</font>

907
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:54,449
<font face="Serif" size="18">give Forge's money
to the people of Never winter.</font>

908
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:56,147
<font face="Serif" size="18">Keep this.</font>

909
01:01:57,322 --> 01:02:00,804
<font face="Serif" size="18">You may not yet
believe your words, but I do.</font>

910
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,286
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah. Good for you.
Simon, hold onto this.</font>

911
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,940
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, where's the helmet?</font>

912
01:02:07,114 --> 01:02:09,638
<font face="Serif" size="18">In the bowels of the Under dark.
The Under dark?</font>

913
01:02:09,813 --> 01:02:11,878
<font face="Serif" size="18">Weren't you trying to keep it safe?
Why would you put it down there?</font>

914
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:14,742
<font face="Serif" size="18">Because it is the last place that
anyone who values their life would go.</font>

915
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,254
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sounds lovely. Quite the opposite.</font>

916
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:18,952
<font face="Serif" size="18">I-I know. I was being ironic.</font>

917
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:22,826
<font face="Serif" size="18">I find irony is a blade that cuts
he who wields it most especially.</font>

918
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,872
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah?
Is that what you find, Xenk?</font>

919
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:28,005
<font face="Serif" size="18">There is an entrance east
of the Sword Mountains</font>

920
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:29,615
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the Kryptgarden Forest,</font>

921
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:32,792
<font face="Serif" size="18">from which we may descend
to the ruins of Dolblunde.</font>

922
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:37,884
<font face="Serif" size="18">If I may be so bold, what caused
you to renounce the Harpers?</font>

923
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:42,976
<font face="Serif" size="18">Being a Harper
got my wife killed.</font>

924
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,283
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm sorry.</font>

925
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:47,198
<font face="Serif" size="18">Did her assailants find justice?</font>

926
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:48,982
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Thayans, you mean?</font>

927
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:51,550
<font face="Serif" size="18">No.</font>

928
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:53,726
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Thayans
are not all malevolent.</font>

929
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:57,730
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was a boy when Szass Tam
seized control of Thay.</font>

930
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:02,996
<font face="Serif" size="18">I saw firsthand
the horrors of the spell.</font>

931
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:07,087
<font face="Serif" size="18">Honorable men
turned to monsters.</font>

932
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:10,221
<font face="Serif" size="18">Minds wiped clean in moments.</font>

933
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:13,964
<font face="Serif" size="18">Parents
turning on their own child.</font>

934
01:03:34,245 --> 01:03:36,813
<font face="Serif" size="18">I escaped, alive,</font>

935
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:40,207
<font face="Serif" size="18">but forever changed.</font>

936
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:43,994
<font face="Serif" size="18">You and I have both lost
a part of ourselves.</font>

937
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:46,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">All that matters is what
we do with what remains.</font>

938
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:49,434
<font face="Serif" size="18">I told you what I'm gonna do.</font>

939
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:51,848
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm gonna break into Castle
Never and get my family back.</font>

940
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:53,481
<font face="Serif" size="18">And the tablet?</font>

941
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:55,832
<font face="Serif" size="18">You plan to resurrect
your wife.Yeah.</font>

942
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,096
<font face="Serif" size="18">Very well.</font>

943
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,162
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'd only ask that you consider that this
plane we call 'life' is but one of many.</font>

944
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:03,404
<font face="Serif" size="18">Uh-huh.</font>

945
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:05,537
<font face="Serif" size="18">To drag your lady-love
back to her old life</font>

946
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,321
<font face="Serif" size="18">is to deprive her
of her new one.</font>

947
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:10,150
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can someone else
ride next to this guy?</font>

948
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,509
<font face="Serif" size="18">Follow me to the orifice.</font>

949
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:26,427
<font face="Serif" size="18">The orifice?</font>

950
01:04:28,038 --> 01:04:30,562
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Under dark
has many entrances.</font>

951
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:35,567
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is one of
the less conspicuous.</font>

952
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:44,706
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'll go last.</font>

953
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:49,886
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's a day's trek. I've chosen
a path to avoid the populace.</font>

954
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,453
<font face="Serif" size="18">Stay close and quiet.</font>

955
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:56,675
<font face="Serif" size="18">Whatever you've heard of this place is
merely a fraction of its true danger.</font>

956
01:04:58,242 --> 01:05:00,244
<font face="Serif" size="18">Should the way become too dim,</font>

957
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:03,334
<font face="Serif" size="18">you may take my hand,
and I will lead you.</font>

958
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:08,992
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'll tell you right now,
I'm not taking his hand.</font>

959
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:23,267
<font face="Serif" size="18">Keep your guard up.
I don't trust this guy.</font>

960
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:26,270
<font face="Serif" size="18">Even though he's helping us?</font>

961
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:28,794
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ah, he's got something
up his sleeve.</font>

962
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,188
<font face="Serif" size="18">The only thing up my sleeve
is my arm.</font>

963
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:34,104
<font face="Serif" size="18">How could he hear that?
I hear that as well.</font>

964
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:35,932
<font face="Serif" size="18">I hate you.</font>

965
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,296
<font face="Serif" size="18">The path to the ruins
is just here.</font>

966
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:01,695
<font face="Serif" size="18">Keep still!</font>

967
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:06,614
<font face="Serif" size="18">Rochnon.</font>

968
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:09,617
<font face="Serif" size="18">Intellect devourers.
Small but formidable.</font>

969
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,534
<font face="Serif" size="18">They stun their targets and consume
the brain, taking control of the body.</font>

970
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,667
<font face="Serif" size="18">What do we do? Make no sound.</font>

971
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:18,975
<font face="Serif" size="18">They're drawn to mental energy.</font>

972
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:23,457
<font face="Serif" size="18">The higher the intelligence of the prey,
the more likely they are to strike.</font>

973
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:42,346
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, that's a little hurtful.</font>

974
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:47,307
<font face="Serif" size="18">There it is.
The Hanging City of Dolblunde.</font>

975
01:06:48,526 --> 01:06:52,356
<font face="Serif" size="18">The helmet lies on the far side
of this chasm.</font>

976
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:56,882
<font face="Serif" size="18">But be warned, the bridge is
protected by an ancient Gnomish trap.</font>

977
01:06:57,056 --> 01:07:00,277
<font face="Serif" size="18">There is a precise formula we must follow
so as not to trigger the mechanism.</font>

978
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,280
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's the formula? It's quite simple.</font>

979
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:05,891
<font face="Serif" size="18">Starting from the center,
use odd-numbered blocks only,</font>

980
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:08,385
<font face="Serif" size="18">moving forward with each step,
except for every fifth step,</font>

981
01:07:08,502 --> 01:07:09,662
<font face="Serif" size="18">which must be a lateral move.</font>

982
01:07:09,808 --> 01:07:11,462
<font face="Serif" size="18">Left or right, it matters not,</font>

983
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,744
<font face="Serif" size="18">so long as the leader and the
laggard remain equidistant.</font>

984
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:16,771
<font face="Serif" size="18">After which, proceed.
Again, odd-numbered blocks only.</font>

985
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:20,036
<font face="Serif" size="18">However, at the midpoint we
switch to even-numbered blocks.</font>

986
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,908
<font face="Serif" size="18">Same pattern, except now a lateral
move after the fourth step,</font>

987
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,258
<font face="Serif" size="18">until we reach the three...</font>

988
01:07:33,527 --> 01:07:35,181
<font face="Serif" size="18">I...</font>

989
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,140
<font face="Serif" size="18">I may have...</font>

990
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:39,446
<font face="Serif" size="18">put my foot on the bridge.</font>

991
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,927
<font face="Serif" size="18">Didn't realize that's where
it technically started.</font>

992
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:47,019
<font face="Serif" size="18">So... sorry.</font>

993
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,071
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's not very
structurally sound.</font>

994
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:59,858
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can't you just magic us across?</font>

995
01:08:00,032 --> 01:08:02,817
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's too far for telekinesis.</font>

996
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:05,603
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've got some rope in my bag.</font>

997
01:08:05,777 --> 01:08:07,344
<font face="Serif" size="18">I could tie it to the axe.</font>

998
01:08:07,518 --> 01:08:09,694
<font face="Serif" size="18">Toss it across
so it sticks to the rock.</font>

999
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:13,263
<font face="Serif" size="18">You know rocks are
hard, right? Shut up.</font>

1000
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:14,742
<font face="Serif" size="18">Where did you get that?</font>

1001
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:17,571
<font face="Serif" size="18">What, Marlamin's walking stick?</font>

1002
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:19,965
<font face="Serif" size="18">I swiped it from a wizard
over in the Grey peaks.</font>

1003
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:21,967
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's not a walking stick.</font>

1004
01:08:23,621 --> 01:08:25,188
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's a Hither-Thither staff.</font>

1005
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:28,191
<font face="Serif" size="18">A what? Should have a range
of around 500 yards.</font>

1006
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:30,802
<font face="Serif" size="18">Watch.</font>

1007
01:08:30,976 --> 01:08:32,108
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hither.</font>

1008
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:34,284
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thither.</font>

1009
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:38,853
<font face="Serif" size="18">It works!</font>

1010
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,553
<font face="Serif" size="18">See?</font>

1011
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:45,643
<font face="Serif" size="18">Didn't even need the bridge!</font>

1012
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:47,862
<font face="Serif" size="18">I did good.</font>

1013
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,213
<font face="Serif" size="18">Good save.</font>

1014
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:35,693
<font face="Serif" size="18">This I give you now, trusting that you
will protect it with your very life.</font>

1015
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:37,521
<font face="Serif" size="18">I will.</font>

1016
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,350
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hold this.</font>

1017
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:46,878
<font face="Serif" size="18">There is evil here.</font>

1018
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:00,108
<font face="Serif" size="18">Are those...</font>

1019
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,241
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thayan assassins.</font>

1020
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:05,505
<font face="Serif" size="18">You look older, Yendar.</font>

1021
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,813
<font face="Serif" size="18">Must be all that
foul mortal blood.</font>

1022
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:13,948
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you, Dralas, look just as
loathsome as the last time we met.</font>

1023
01:10:14,122 --> 01:10:19,302
<font face="Serif" size="18">Then I'll see to it
we don't meet again.</font>

1024
01:10:19,476 --> 01:10:21,478
<font face="Serif" size="18">Leave them to me.</font>

1025
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:56,268
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm glad he's on our side.</font>

1026
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:01,141
<font face="Serif" size="18">We must flee.</font>

1027
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:02,927
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why? You killed them all.</font>

1028
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:05,712
<font face="Serif" size="18">'Tis no simple feat to kill
that which is already dead.</font>

1029
01:12:10,717 --> 01:12:12,850
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ready for the next bout, Yendar?</font>

1030
01:12:15,156 --> 01:12:16,810
<font face="Serif" size="18">Quickly!</font>

1031
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:06,817
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's one pudgy dragon.</font>

1032
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:10,168
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's Themberchaud.
He must have found a new den.</font>

1033
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:11,822
<font face="Serif" size="18">Did he eat the last one?</font>

1034
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:30,204
<font face="Serif" size="18">I got you!</font>

1035
01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:43,174
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's a dead end!</font>

1036
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:45,829
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon! Up there!</font>

1037
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:39,230
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thanks for that.</font>

1038
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,972
<font face="Serif" size="18">You'd have done the same for me.</font>

1039
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:44,714
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah.</font>

1040
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:48,848
<font face="Serif" size="18">Bastard won't quit!</font>

1041
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:01,644
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on! He's stuck!</font>

1042
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,080
<font face="Serif" size="18">So are we.</font>

1043
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:12,263
<font face="Serif" size="18">We're gonna drown!</font>

1044
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:15,527
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, portal us out of here! I can
only portal us to what I can see!</font>

1045
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,381
<font face="Serif" size="18">You want to go from
that wall to that wall?</font>

1046
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,663
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's salt water.</font>

1047
01:16:20,837 --> 01:16:23,579
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon, you remember that trick
you did in Triboar?</font>

1048
01:16:23,753 --> 01:16:24,753
<font face="Serif" size="18">Fresh-cut grass smell?</font>

1049
01:16:24,884 --> 01:16:27,191
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, the flame finger one.</font>

1050
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:29,106
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, why? Holga, hit him!</font>

1051
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,108
<font face="Serif" size="18">You want to make him angrier?</font>

1052
01:16:31,282 --> 01:16:33,676
<font face="Serif" size="18">When I say so,
everybody goes underwater.</font>

1053
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:36,287
<font face="Serif" size="18">And that'll be your cue, Simon,
all right?</font>

1054
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:38,071
<font face="Serif" size="18">What are you looking at?</font>

1055
01:16:38,245 --> 01:16:41,074
<font face="Serif" size="18">A Harper shaking off
his slumber.</font>

1056
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,599
<font face="Serif" size="18">Go, Holga!</font>

1057
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:49,517
<font face="Serif" size="18">Again!</font>

1058
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:53,738
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now!</font>

1059
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:33,953
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is where I leave you.</font>

1060
01:17:34,127 --> 01:17:36,303
<font face="Serif" size="18">I wish you every success
on your journey.</font>

1061
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:40,438
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're not coming? Would that I could.</font>

1062
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:43,049
<font face="Serif" size="18">But this is your quest.</font>

1063
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:46,574
<font face="Serif" size="18">I have given you the tools.
You must utilize them.</font>

1064
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,402
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can't you utilize them for us?</font>

1065
01:17:48,576 --> 01:17:51,101
<font face="Serif" size="18">Because you're much better
at fighting and strategy and...</font>

1066
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:53,669
<font face="Serif" size="18">Pretty much everything
but talking.</font>

1067
01:17:55,366 --> 01:17:56,497
<font face="Serif" size="18">Talking to you isn't great.</font>

1068
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,760
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mmm.</font>

1069
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:02,765
<font face="Serif" size="18">In those instances where
faith wanes and doubt waxes,</font>

1070
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:04,419
<font face="Serif" size="18">I recall
the Tenets of the Ancients...</font>

1071
01:18:04,592 --> 01:18:06,333
<font face="Serif" size="18">Okay. See you later.</font>

1072
01:18:21,914 --> 01:18:23,263
<font face="Serif" size="18">There he goes.</font>

1073
01:18:25,483 --> 01:18:27,093
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just wandering off.</font>

1074
01:18:28,616 --> 01:18:30,967
<font face="Serif" size="18">Walks in such a straight line.</font>

1075
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:34,057
<font face="Serif" size="18">Uh-oh. Wait a minute.
He's coming up on a rock.</font>

1076
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:36,407
<font face="Serif" size="18">Is he gonna go around?</font>

1077
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:37,843
<font face="Serif" size="18">Nope.</font>

1078
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:39,845
<font face="Serif" size="18">Right over the rock.</font>

1079
01:18:47,113 --> 01:18:48,854
<font face="Serif" size="18">What are you mumbling?</font>

1080
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:51,161
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm preparing to attune.</font>

1081
01:18:51,335 --> 01:18:53,990
<font face="Serif" size="18">If I can't connect with it,
it'll be useless.</font>

1082
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:58,211
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's a lot of pressure, given
all we went through to get it.</font>

1083
01:18:58,385 --> 01:18:59,952
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, I realize that.</font>

1084
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:04,348
<font face="Serif" size="18">So our entire fate rests on you.</font>

1085
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:07,133
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on.</font>

1086
01:19:30,113 --> 01:19:33,507
<font face="Serif" size="18">There he is,
the great Simon Aumar.</font>

1087
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:36,597
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sorcerer descended
from wizarding blood.</font>

1088
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,034
<font face="Serif" size="18">Who are you?</font>

1089
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:40,166
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don't you know me?</font>

1090
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,909
<font face="Serif" size="18">My name is Aumar too.</font>

1091
01:19:45,606 --> 01:19:46,999
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're my
great-great grandfather.</font>

1092
01:19:50,568 --> 01:19:52,657
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's quite a helm.</font>

1093
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,616
<font face="Serif" size="18">What makes you think
you're worthy of it?</font>

1094
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,445
<font face="Serif" size="18">I believe in myself?</font>

1095
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:00,056
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're asking me?</font>

1096
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,319
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, I'm... I'm sure.</font>

1097
01:20:02,493 --> 01:20:04,103
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm a great sorcerer.</font>

1098
01:20:04,277 --> 01:20:05,626
<font face="Serif" size="18">Are you now?</font>

1099
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,673
<font face="Serif" size="18">Funny thing about magic.</font>

1100
01:20:09,717 --> 01:20:12,068
<font face="Serif" size="18">It chooses who may wield it.</font>

1101
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:14,548
<font face="Serif" size="18">And it does not suffer fools.</font>

1102
01:20:14,722 --> 01:20:16,072
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why are you telling me this?</font>

1103
01:20:16,246 --> 01:20:19,336
<font face="Serif" size="18">I think you know, Simon.</font>

1104
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:25,516
<font face="Serif" size="18">Did you attune with it?</font>

1105
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:26,996
<font face="Serif" size="18">You okay?</font>

1106
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:28,649
<font face="Serif" size="18">I got you.</font>

1107
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:31,478
<font face="Serif" size="18">What happened?</font>

1108
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:32,871
<font face="Serif" size="18">I, uh...</font>

1109
01:20:33,045 --> 01:20:35,134
<font face="Serif" size="18">- I spoke to someone.
- Yeah?</font>

1110
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:37,180
<font face="Serif" size="18">My great-great grandfather.
He was...</font>

1111
01:20:38,224 --> 01:20:38,964
<font face="Serif" size="18">unhelpful.</font>

1112
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:41,097
<font face="Serif" size="18">You spoke to him?</font>

1113
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:43,989
<font face="Serif" size="18">From here, it looked like the helmet
flew off the second you put it on.</font>

1114
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:45,841
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, time moves
differently there.</font>

1115
01:20:46,015 --> 01:20:47,843
<font face="Serif" size="18">Okay,
I'll try a different approach.</font>

1116
01:20:48,017 --> 01:20:50,019
<font face="Serif" size="18">Great. New approach. Try it.</font>

1117
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:52,760
<font face="Serif" size="18">You got this.
You got this.</font>

1118
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:01,465
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're getting better.
You didn't fly as far.</font>

1119
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:03,032
<font face="Serif" size="18">Stick with it.</font>

1120
01:21:03,206 --> 01:21:04,923
<font face="Serif" size="18">We have six hours till
we leave for Never winter.</font>

1121
01:21:04,947 --> 01:21:06,818
<font face="Serif" size="18">You fail, I never
get my family back.</font>

1122
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:08,080
<font face="Serif" size="18">Brilliant.</font>

1123
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:29,449
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've never seen a bigger coward.</font>

1124
01:21:29,623 --> 01:21:32,061
<font face="Serif" size="18">Coward?
You're under here, too.</font>

1125
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:33,932
<font face="Serif" size="18">Fine. I'll handle it.</font>

1126
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:35,891
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, no, no.</font>

1127
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,545
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've got this.</font>

1128
01:21:40,852 --> 01:21:43,159
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you want to be a Harper.</font>

1129
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,595
<font face="Serif" size="18">Quiet!</font>

1130
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:51,167
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, God. Damn.</font>

1131
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:53,082
<font face="Serif" size="18">There it is.</font>

1132
01:21:54,605 --> 01:21:56,694
<font face="Serif" size="18">Stop trying to capture it.</font>

1133
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,613
<font face="Serif" size="18">You just have to let it go.</font>

1134
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:05,137
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ed!</font>

1135
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:08,575
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ed! We've got a problem.</font>

1136
01:22:08,749 --> 01:22:10,142
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can't do it.</font>

1137
01:22:11,187 --> 01:22:12,971
<font face="Serif" size="18">- The helmet?
- I've been at it for hours!</font>

1138
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:14,930
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can't get past
the old bastard!</font>

1139
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:17,410
<font face="Serif" size="18">I said I couldn't attune.
Now I'm the prat!</font>

1140
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,108
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's the racket?</font>

1141
01:22:19,282 --> 01:22:21,458
<font face="Serif" size="18">He's having
a little trouble with the helm.</font>

1142
01:22:21,632 --> 01:22:23,721
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on, Simon, just do it.</font>

1143
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:27,116
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh. Yeah, okay. Yeah.
Thanks, Holga. I'll just do it.</font>

1144
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:30,075
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is exactly what I told you
would happen back at the tavern,</font>

1145
01:22:30,249 --> 01:22:33,078
<font face="Serif" size="18">but you wouldn't listen. What
do you mean, you told him?</font>

1146
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:35,167
<font face="Serif" size="18">He said to keep it
between us for morale.</font>

1147
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:36,952
<font face="Serif" size="18">I... Do you know why?</font>

1148
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:39,955
<font face="Serif" size="18">Because he is the most pigheaded
person I've ever known!</font>

1149
01:22:40,129 --> 01:22:42,261
<font face="Serif" size="18">You talk us into doing things
you know won't work,</font>

1150
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:44,481
<font face="Serif" size="18">and then you blame us
when it goes pear-shaped!</font>

1151
01:22:44,655 --> 01:22:46,918
<font face="Serif" size="18">If you can't attune,
we'll figure out a Plan B.</font>

1152
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,659
<font face="Serif" size="18">Plan B?
We dug up my family.</font>

1153
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,617
<font face="Serif" size="18">We went to the Under dark
for that helmet.</font>

1154
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,142
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you knew the whole time
that he couldn't use it?</font>

1155
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:55,100
<font face="Serif" size="18">You humans.
You just can't help but lie.</font>

1156
01:22:55,274 --> 01:22:57,973
<font face="Serif" size="18">I didn't lie. I really
thought Simon could do it.</font>

1157
01:22:58,147 --> 01:23:01,063
<font face="Serif" size="18">Guys, look. We got a couple
hours till the games begin.</font>

1158
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:03,413
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is what we do.
We pivot.</font>

1159
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:06,111
<font face="Serif" size="18">Instead of dwelling on what
went wrong and who lied to whom,</font>

1160
01:23:06,285 --> 01:23:08,285
<font face="Serif" size="18">let's put our heads together
and figure out a plan!</font>

1161
01:23:08,331 --> 01:23:10,246
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm gonna figure out
my way home.</font>

1162
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,509
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can't believe I put
my faith in any of you.</font>

1163
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:15,468
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, I'm going too.
Sorry about Kira.</font>

1164
01:23:17,905 --> 01:23:20,473
<font face="Serif" size="18">We'll find another way
to get her. Just not today.</font>

1165
01:23:20,647 --> 01:23:23,694
<font face="Serif" size="18">It has to be today. We're not
done until my daughter's safe.</font>

1166
01:23:23,868 --> 01:23:25,043
<font face="Serif" size="18">Aren't you sick of failing?</font>

1167
01:23:25,217 --> 01:23:27,176
<font face="Serif" size="18">No! That's the whole point!</font>

1168
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:31,571
<font face="Serif" size="18">We must never stop failing, because
the minute we do, we've failed.</font>

1169
01:23:32,398 --> 01:23:34,313
<font face="Serif" size="18">Huh? Look,</font>

1170
01:23:34,487 --> 01:23:38,535
<font face="Serif" size="18">none of us here can say our lives
have gone the way we had hoped for.</font>

1171
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:40,145
<font face="Serif" size="18">Right?</font>

1172
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:41,712
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga.</font>

1173
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:43,844
<font face="Serif" size="18">You left your tribe
to be with a man</font>

1174
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,587
<font face="Serif" size="18">who left you because you were so
upset about leaving your tribe.</font>

1175
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:50,068
<font face="Serif" size="18">And if you quit now,
that's in stone!</font>

1176
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:52,114
<font face="Serif" size="18">Same with you, Simon.</font>

1177
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:55,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're a petty thief masquerading
as a pettier sorcerer.</font>

1178
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:58,033
<font face="Serif" size="18">You gonna go back to your show?
It's better than dying.</font>

1179
01:23:58,207 --> 01:23:59,817
<font face="Serif" size="18">There's worse things than dying.</font>

1180
01:23:59,991 --> 01:24:01,906
<font face="Serif" size="18">And, Doric, you have integrity,</font>

1181
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,040
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I am sure the last thing you want
to do is tell the Emerald Enclave</font>

1182
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:07,564
<font face="Serif" size="18">that you had a chance to save
them but you walked away.</font>

1183
01:24:07,738 --> 01:24:10,436
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hey, You're quick to call us failures.
What about you, Ed?</font>

1184
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:14,136
<font face="Serif" size="18">Me? I'm the champion
of failures!</font>

1185
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:17,400
<font face="Serif" size="18">I lost everything that ever mattered
to me and it was all my fault.</font>

1186
01:24:23,406 --> 01:24:25,625
<font face="Serif" size="18">You want to know who
really killed my wife?</font>

1187
01:24:28,498 --> 01:24:29,629
<font face="Serif" size="18">I did.</font>

1188
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:34,547
<font face="Serif" size="18">I decided we deserved a better life
than a Harper's oath would allow us.</font>

1189
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,857
<font face="Serif" size="18">But I didn't know that Red
Wizards marked their treasure.</font>

1190
01:24:42,555 --> 01:24:44,383
<font face="Serif" size="18">I led them right to our door.</font>

1191
01:24:46,994 --> 01:24:50,128
<font face="Serif" size="18">I didn't even have the good luck
to be home when they got there.</font>

1192
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:54,741
<font face="Serif" size="18">I failed the Harpers, I failed
my family, I failed all of you.</font>

1193
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:56,787
<font face="Serif" size="18">Which is exactly why
I can't quit.</font>

1194
01:24:56,961 --> 01:24:59,659
<font face="Serif" size="18">So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go sit on this rock</font>

1195
01:25:00,617 --> 01:25:02,097
<font face="Serif" size="18">and make a plan.</font>

1196
01:25:14,848 --> 01:25:16,154
<font face="Serif" size="18">Move over.</font>

1197
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:54,366
<font face="Serif" size="18">I 'd sit too, but there's
no more room on the rock.</font>

1198
01:25:56,847 --> 01:25:58,109
<font face="Serif" size="18">How about this?</font>

1199
01:25:59,415 --> 01:26:01,721
<font face="Serif" size="18">We use the Hither-Thither Staff
to get into the vault.</font>

1200
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:03,462
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, I've explained this.</font>

1201
01:26:03,636 --> 01:26:05,484
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can't Hither-Thither
into a room you can't see.</font>

1202
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:06,944
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm not saying that.</font>

1203
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:09,425
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm saying we put
the portal on something</font>

1204
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:11,775
<font face="Serif" size="18">and then sneak that thing
into the vault.</font>

1205
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:15,082
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mmm. The only thing going
in that vault is treasure.</font>

1206
01:26:15,257 --> 01:26:17,650
<font face="Serif" size="18">So we put the portal
on some treasure.</font>

1207
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,829
<font face="Serif" size="18">Forge did say the richest men
in Baldur's Gate and Water deep</font>

1208
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:24,788
<font face="Serif" size="18">are bringing loot to the city.</font>

1209
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:27,704
<font face="Serif" size="18">They'll be traveling
the High Road.</font>

1210
01:26:27,878 --> 01:26:30,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">We could catch one of their convoys!
There'll be dozens of guards.</font>

1211
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:32,119
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, but the guards will
be guarding against people</font>

1212
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:34,972
<font face="Serif" size="18">taking things out of their
wagon, not putting them in!</font>

1213
01:26:35,146 --> 01:26:37,409
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga, I could kiss you! Try it.</font>

1214
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,937
<font face="Serif" size="18">Perfect.
Thank you so much.</font>

1215
01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:01,450
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh!</font>

1216
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:29,086
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh!</font>

1217
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:11,215
<font face="Serif" size="18">What a profound joy
it is to welcome you,</font>

1218
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:15,175
<font face="Serif" size="18">the good people of Never winter,
to the resumption</font>

1219
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,004
<font face="Serif" size="18">of the High Sun Games!</font>

1220
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:25,185
<font face="Serif" size="18">I guarantee that you are in for
the most riveting spectacle</font>

1221
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,362
<font face="Serif" size="18">on all the Sword Coast.</font>

1222
01:29:27,536 --> 01:29:29,799
<font face="Serif" size="18">The rules are very simple:</font>

1223
01:29:29,973 --> 01:29:33,977
<font face="Serif" size="18">Five harrowing challenges.
Five teams of champions.</font>

1224
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:37,372
<font face="Serif" size="18">Whoever survives to reach
the Cage of Sanctuary</font>

1225
01:29:37,546 --> 01:29:40,462
<font face="Serif" size="18">moves on to the next stage.</font>

1226
01:29:41,288 --> 01:29:43,465
<font face="Serif" size="18">One thing: I do urge you,</font>

1227
01:29:43,639 --> 01:29:47,643
<font face="Serif" size="18">please do not leave the arena
till the close of the games,</font>

1228
01:29:47,817 --> 01:29:50,080
<font face="Serif" size="18">as there will be
a wonderful gift</font>

1229
01:29:50,254 --> 01:29:53,257
<font face="Serif" size="18">for each and every one of you!</font>

1230
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:00,351
<font face="Serif" size="18">All right, take me down.</font>

1231
01:30:00,525 --> 01:30:02,614
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is absurdly high.
It's not what we discussed.</font>

1232
01:30:04,964 --> 01:30:07,227
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on.
Gotta get it all done.</font>

1233
01:30:16,715 --> 01:30:18,674
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, no. What happened?</font>

1234
01:30:18,848 --> 01:30:21,503
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's facing the floor. Why
would they store it that way?</font>

1235
01:30:28,161 --> 01:30:29,815
<font face="Serif" size="18">Damn it. Why does nothing
go our way?</font>

1236
01:30:29,989 --> 01:30:31,774
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let me try.
Maybe I can make a gap.</font>

1237
01:30:33,384 --> 01:30:34,907
<font face="Serif" size="18">The games have started.</font>

1238
01:30:36,213 --> 01:30:39,085
<font face="Serif" size="18">We 're going to Plan C.Oh, bollocks.
What's Plan C?</font>

1239
01:30:39,259 --> 01:30:41,653
<font face="Serif" size="18">Plan C is we go back to Plan A.</font>

1240
01:30:41,827 --> 01:30:43,147
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're gonna attune
to the helmet.</font>

1241
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,265
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why don't you
just call it Plan A?</font>

1242
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,288
<font face="Serif" size="18">Plan A has a stink on it. You know
damn well I can't attune to the thing.</font>

1243
01:30:48,312 --> 01:30:50,619
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's not true!
You couldn't attune to it.</font>

1244
01:30:50,793 --> 01:30:53,012
<font face="Serif" size="18">Look at me.
Look at me! Huh?</font>

1245
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:54,884
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do you remember that job
in Loudwater?</font>

1246
01:30:55,058 --> 01:30:58,017
<font face="Serif" size="18">You couldn't spider climb until
Jolym sicced his dog on you.</font>

1247
01:30:58,191 --> 01:31:00,150
<font face="Serif" size="18">And when we robbed
the spear of Aoth Fezim,</font>

1248
01:31:00,324 --> 01:31:03,240
<font face="Serif" size="18">your stone skin spell failed until
the arrows were inches away.</font>

1249
01:31:03,414 --> 01:31:07,026
<font face="Serif" size="18">Even in Triboar, you flipped
the gravity of a whole theater!</font>

1250
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,245
<font face="Serif" size="18">You did?</font>

1251
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,074
<font face="Serif" size="18">By accident.
It was wild magic,</font>

1252
01:31:11,248 --> 01:31:14,294
<font face="Serif" size="18">and that only happened
because they were gonna kill me. Exactly!</font>

1253
01:31:15,252 --> 01:31:17,515
<font face="Serif" size="18">Look, you are at your strongest</font>

1254
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,822
<font face="Serif" size="18">when you think
you're at your weakest.</font>

1255
01:31:19,996 --> 01:31:21,693
<font face="Serif" size="18">But you deliver.</font>

1256
01:31:23,434 --> 01:31:26,132
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're gonna get
into that vault, okay?</font>

1257
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:27,830
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not because you can...</font>

1258
01:31:29,745 --> 01:31:30,963
<font face="Serif" size="18">but because you must.</font>

1259
01:31:31,834 --> 01:31:33,836
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm gonna keep chipping away.</font>

1260
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:36,641
<font face="Serif" size="18">If I can get a quarter inch, I'll be
able to squeeze through as a worm.</font>

1261
01:31:36,665 --> 01:31:37,883
<font face="Serif" size="18">As a worm!</font>

1262
01:31:38,057 --> 01:31:39,494
<font face="Serif" size="18">As a worm, perfect.</font>

1263
01:31:39,668 --> 01:31:41,670
<font face="Serif" size="18">You see this? Now we have
a Plan D if Plan C fails.</font>

1264
01:31:41,844 --> 01:31:43,672
<font face="Serif" size="18">Isn't Plan D just Plan B again?</font>

1265
01:31:43,846 --> 01:31:46,936
<font face="Serif" size="18">Plan B has a stink too. It all stinks.</font>

1266
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:49,547
<font face="Serif" size="18">Here. Use this
to keep in contact.</font>

1267
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:52,071
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, um, this is a rock.</font>

1268
01:31:52,245 --> 01:31:53,551
<font face="Serif" size="18">Actually it is...</font>

1269
01:31:53,725 --> 01:31:55,292
<font face="Serif" size="18">a sending stone.</font>

1270
01:31:55,466 --> 01:31:56,946
<font face="Serif" size="18">But they'll only work
for an hour.</font>

1271
01:31:57,773 --> 01:31:59,296
<font face="Serif" size="18">Clever.</font>

1272
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,126
<font face="Serif" size="18">So how we gonna get in there?</font>

1273
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,389
<font face="Serif" size="18">Easy.
We just create a distraction.</font>

1274
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:08,697
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, I got a good feeling
about Plan C.</font>

1275
01:32:22,319 --> 01:32:24,060
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's your business here?</font>

1276
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,629
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's going on?
You're messing up my song!</font>

1277
01:32:51,653 --> 01:32:52,828
<font face="Serif" size="18">My foot is stuck.</font>

1278
01:32:53,002 --> 01:32:54,786
<font face="Serif" size="18">Concentrate, Simon.</font>

1279
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,096
<font face="Serif" size="18">What madness is this?</font>

1280
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:07,930
<font face="Serif" size="18">I think they're starting
to get suspicious.</font>

1281
01:33:11,063 --> 01:33:12,238
<font face="Serif" size="18">Nine hells.</font>

1282
01:33:13,675 --> 01:33:15,764
<font face="Serif" size="18">There! Interlopers! Come on!</font>

1283
01:33:23,815 --> 01:33:25,556
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kira's room should be up there.</font>

1284
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:28,341
<font face="Serif" size="18">Find the vault
and we'll meet you. Go!</font>

1285
01:33:28,515 --> 01:33:29,515
<font face="Serif" size="18">Halt!</font>

1286
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:39,154
<font face="Serif" size="18">- There she is!
- Hold your weapons!</font>

1287
01:33:39,178 --> 01:33:40,789
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'll hold them.
Find the vault.</font>

1288
01:33:40,963 --> 01:33:43,269
<font face="Serif" size="18">You sure I can't help? I'm certain.</font>

1289
01:33:43,443 --> 01:33:45,837
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mmm, you don't
have to be so certain. Get her!</font>

1290
01:34:17,826 --> 01:34:20,480
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now listen carefully.</font>

1291
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,179
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm with the Absolution Council.
They've just gone up.</font>

1292
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,202
<font face="Serif" size="18">Go! Quickly!</font>

1293
01:35:06,396 --> 01:35:07,440
<font face="Serif" size="18">Open up!</font>

1294
01:35:07,614 --> 01:35:09,399
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just a minute!</font>

1295
01:35:29,245 --> 01:35:30,463
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't mind that.</font>

1296
01:35:33,815 --> 01:35:35,294
<font face="Serif" size="18">Okay, you can do this.</font>

1297
01:35:35,468 --> 01:35:37,079
<font face="Serif" size="18">Relax. No rush.</font>

1298
01:35:37,253 --> 01:35:38,820
<font face="Serif" size="18">There he is!</font>

1299
01:35:42,432 --> 01:35:44,913
<font face="Serif" size="18">Look who's back.
The would-be sorcerer.</font>

1300
01:35:45,087 --> 01:35:48,525
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't have time for this! Yet I have
all the time there is.</font>

1301
01:35:48,699 --> 01:35:51,049
<font face="Serif" size="18">You don't get it. We're going
to die if I don't attune!</font>

1302
01:35:51,223 --> 01:35:54,183
<font face="Serif" size="18">So you die a fool.
It's better than to live as one.</font>

1303
01:35:54,357 --> 01:35:56,054
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's enough!
You don't know me.</font>

1304
01:35:56,228 --> 01:35:58,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know you're a stain
on your family name!</font>

1305
01:35:59,144 --> 01:36:01,016
<font face="Serif" size="18">To hell with my name!
Let me attune!</font>

1306
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:03,540
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not while I live. You don't live!</font>

1307
01:36:03,714 --> 01:36:05,847
<font face="Serif" size="18">You had your time.
Now it's my turn.</font>

1308
01:36:06,021 --> 01:36:07,196
<font face="Serif" size="18">I won't allow it.</font>

1309
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,675
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't care!</font>

1310
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:11,635
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sorry.</font>

1311
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:17,336
<font face="Serif" size="18">Took you long enough.</font>

1312
01:36:33,657 --> 01:36:34,701
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon!</font>

1313
01:36:36,181 --> 01:36:37,269
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon, was that you?</font>

1314
01:36:37,443 --> 01:36:39,576
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was! I did it!</font>

1315
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,969
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well done.</font>

1316
01:36:42,013 --> 01:36:43,754
<font face="Serif" size="18">I guess it was just me
holding me back.</font>

1317
01:36:43,928 --> 01:36:45,364
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's what I' ve been saying!</font>

1318
01:36:54,243 --> 01:36:55,461
<font face="Serif" size="18">I made it inside the vault.</font>

1319
01:36:55,635 --> 01:36:57,289
<font face="Serif" size="18">So did we.</font>

1320
01:36:58,290 --> 01:36:59,988
<font face="Serif" size="18">There's nothing here.</font>

1321
01:37:00,162 --> 01:37:02,599
<font face="Serif" size="18">What do you mean?
It's all here. Where are you?</font>

1322
01:37:02,773 --> 01:37:03,818
<font face="Serif" size="18">Where are you?</font>

1323
01:37:04,601 --> 01:37:06,037
<font face="Serif" size="18">I think I'm under the arena.</font>

1324
01:37:07,996 --> 01:37:08,996
<font face="Serif" size="18">Forge.</font>

1325
01:37:09,127 --> 01:37:10,476
<font face="Serif" size="18">This one here.</font>

1326
01:37:28,755 --> 01:37:30,235
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, that's not good.</font>

1327
01:37:38,722 --> 01:37:40,680
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon! Doric! You there?</font>

1328
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,378
<font face="Serif" size="18">What are you doing here?</font>

1329
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:44,293
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kir!</font>

1330
01:37:46,469 --> 01:37:47,687
<font face="Serif" size="18">I came for you.</font>

1331
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:49,254
<font face="Serif" size="18">We have to go.</font>

1332
01:37:50,168 --> 01:37:51,691
<font face="Serif" size="18">You left me.</font>

1333
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:55,347
<font face="Serif" size="18">No. No, I know you think
I'm a liar and a bad father,</font>

1334
01:37:55,521 --> 01:37:56,958
<font face="Serif" size="18">but...</font>

1335
01:38:00,352 --> 01:38:01,876
<font face="Serif" size="18">I am a bad father.</font>

1336
01:38:05,227 --> 01:38:07,011
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I did leave you.</font>

1337
01:38:07,185 --> 01:38:09,361
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I wasn't trying
to bring your mom back.</font>

1338
01:38:09,535 --> 01:38:10,972
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was trying to...</font>

1339
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:13,583
<font face="Serif" size="18">bring my wife back.</font>

1340
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,892
<font face="Serif" size="18">Which if... maybe if you had
gotten a chance to know her</font>

1341
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:21,417
<font face="Serif" size="18">and love her like I did,
you'd understand.</font>

1342
01:38:21,591 --> 01:38:23,419
<font face="Serif" size="18">But if you come with me now,</font>

1343
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,900
<font face="Serif" size="18">you can have that chance.</font>

1344
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:29,859
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hmm.</font>

1345
01:38:48,096 --> 01:38:50,837
<font face="Serif" size="18">You 'd think you'd be
able to distinguish between</font>

1346
01:38:51,012 --> 01:38:53,623
<font face="Serif" size="18">your own daughter
and a 300-year-old wizard.</font>

1347
01:38:53,797 --> 01:38:55,016
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don't worry, Kira's safe.</font>

1348
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:56,974
<font face="Serif" size="18">Unlike me, she had no idea
you were coming.</font>

1349
01:38:57,148 --> 01:39:00,760
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't think she knows how
tenacious you've become. Huh?</font>

1350
01:39:02,284 --> 01:39:03,850
<font face="Serif" size="18">Look, Ed, um...</font>

1351
01:39:06,853 --> 01:39:09,465
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm really sorry about the
way things have worked out.</font>

1352
01:39:10,466 --> 01:39:12,729
<font face="Serif" size="18">But I think if you were
truly honest,</font>

1353
01:39:12,903 --> 01:39:15,819
<font face="Serif" size="18">you'd have to admit I can
give Kira a better life.</font>

1354
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,430
<font face="Serif" size="18">I hope you can
take comfort in knowing</font>

1355
01:39:18,604 --> 01:39:20,737
<font face="Serif" size="18">that she's with the father
she deserves, yeah?</font>

1356
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:23,566
<font face="Serif" size="18">And now I'm in
a pickle because...</font>

1357
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,655
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't want to see you die.</font>

1358
01:39:26,917 --> 01:39:30,486
<font face="Serif" size="18">Which is why
I'm gonna leave the room.</font>

1359
01:39:33,184 --> 01:39:34,184
<font face="Serif" size="18">What?</font>

1360
01:39:42,802 --> 01:39:45,283
<font face="Serif" size="18">If you're gonna kill us, at
least let us die with dignity.</font>

1361
01:39:45,457 --> 01:39:48,460
<font face="Serif" size="18">How do you mean? Put us
in the High Sun Games.</font>

1362
01:39:48,634 --> 01:39:51,028
<font face="Serif" size="18">Give us a fighting chance.
That's not a chance.</font>

1363
01:39:51,202 --> 01:39:52,987
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's not a chance at all.</font>

1364
01:39:53,161 --> 01:39:56,077
<font face="Serif" size="18">I mean, even if you were to
somehow survive the tournament,</font>

1365
01:39:56,251 --> 01:39:57,687
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sofina's gonna...</font>

1366
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:03,998
<font face="Serif" size="18">It would be much, much better for you
to die here than to go to the games.</font>

1367
01:40:04,172 --> 01:40:07,566
<font face="Serif" size="18">No. They defeated
your men and mine.</font>

1368
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:09,394
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let them fight in the arena.</font>

1369
01:40:10,265 --> 01:40:12,223
<font face="Serif" size="18">They deserve that much.</font>

1370
01:40:14,617 --> 01:40:16,880
<font face="Serif" size="18">To the games?</font>

1371
01:40:17,054 --> 01:40:20,275
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh. Yeah.
That was sort of a bad day.</font>

1372
01:40:20,449 --> 01:40:21,493
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh.</font>

1373
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:23,191
<font face="Serif" size="18">You might want
to go back to sleep.</font>

1374
01:40:23,365 --> 01:40:24,540
<font face="Serif" size="18">Are we...</font>

1375
01:40:24,714 --> 01:40:26,716
<font face="Serif" size="18">In the arena.</font>

1376
01:40:28,587 --> 01:40:31,242
<font face="Serif" size="18">This dummy talked Forge into
putting us in the games.</font>

1377
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:33,114
<font face="Serif" size="18">Dummy? I saved our lives!</font>

1378
01:40:33,288 --> 01:40:35,266
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I got us right above where
Doric said the treasure was.</font>

1379
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:37,770
<font face="Serif" size="18">Isn't it a little suspect
that Sofina would agree to this?</font>

1380
01:40:37,944 --> 01:40:40,817
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, she's definitely
planned something.</font>

1381
01:40:40,991 --> 01:40:42,732
<font face="Serif" size="18">Where under the arena were you?</font>

1382
01:40:43,428 --> 01:40:44,777
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do you remember?</font>

1383
01:40:45,561 --> 01:40:46,649
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not sure.</font>

1384
01:40:47,998 --> 01:40:49,739
<font face="Serif" size="18">There was a dock down there.</font>

1385
01:40:49,913 --> 01:40:52,742
<font face="Serif" size="18">I saw guards loading
everything onto a ship.</font>

1386
01:40:54,657 --> 01:40:58,443
<font face="Serif" size="18">A ship. Forge wasn't hiding
the loot from us.</font>

1387
01:40:58,617 --> 01:41:00,576
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was stealing it for himself.</font>

1388
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:03,622
<font face="Serif" size="18">He never cared about being Lord. That
just gave him access to the vault.</font>

1389
01:41:03,796 --> 01:41:06,316
<font face="Serif" size="18">He must have brought back the
games so the take would be bigger.</font>

1390
01:41:07,931 --> 01:41:12,501
<font face="Serif" size="18">What about Kira? He won't leave her behind.
We have to get to that boat.</font>

1391
01:41:12,675 --> 01:41:16,461
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't understand. If Forge is leaving,
what does Sofina get out of this?</font>

1392
01:41:24,948 --> 01:41:26,776
<font face="Serif" size="18">Maybe I can get us out of here.</font>

1393
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:33,261
<font face="Serif" size="18">Magic suppression cuff.
They put one on me too.</font>

1394
01:41:33,435 --> 01:41:35,480
<font face="Serif" size="18">And just when you were
getting good at it.</font>

1395
01:42:36,237 --> 01:42:38,064
<font face="Serif" size="18">So we just go through the maze?</font>

1396
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:40,154
<font face="Serif" size="18">I guess till we reach the cage?</font>

1397
01:42:46,290 --> 01:42:47,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">Run!</font>

1398
01:42:51,991 --> 01:42:53,167
<font face="Serif" size="18">Find the cage!</font>

1399
01:43:02,567 --> 01:43:03,655
<font face="Serif" size="18">Follow me!</font>

1400
01:43:13,796 --> 01:43:14,840
<font face="Serif" size="18">Whoa, whoa!</font>

1401
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,495
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thanks.</font>

1402
01:44:03,193 --> 01:44:05,587
<font face="Serif" size="18">- Where are the others?
- Come on, this way.</font>

1403
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:13,334
<font face="Serif" size="18">Have you tried
Displacer Beast meat?</font>

1404
01:44:14,073 --> 01:44:15,858
<font face="Serif" size="18">No. It's too gamey for me.</font>

1405
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:19,514
<font face="Serif" size="18">The ship is ready, sir.</font>

1406
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,523
<font face="Serif" size="18">It seems my ship is ready, so...</font>

1407
01:44:29,524 --> 01:44:32,048
<font face="Serif" size="18">Kira and I will
be taking our leave.</font>

1408
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:38,359
<font face="Serif" size="18">I do hope that our collaboration has been
as gratifying for you as it has for...</font>

1409
01:44:38,533 --> 01:44:40,491
<font face="Serif" size="18">Get out of my city.</font>

1410
01:44:40,665 --> 01:44:41,884
<font face="Serif" size="18">Right.</font>

1411
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,411
<font face="Serif" size="18">Get out of the way!</font>

1412
01:44:48,238 --> 01:44:49,413
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's burning!</font>

1413
01:44:55,027 --> 01:44:57,029
<font face="Serif" size="18">Another minute,
I would have lost my hand.</font>

1414
01:44:57,203 --> 01:44:58,814
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, but look what
you did lose.</font>

1415
01:44:59,554 --> 01:45:00,554
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on.</font>

1416
01:45:00,685 --> 01:45:02,470
<font face="Serif" size="18">Doric? Doric!</font>

1417
01:45:02,644 --> 01:45:04,776
<font face="Serif" size="18">There must be a way
to get out of the arena.</font>

1418
01:45:22,185 --> 01:45:23,534
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on! Come on!</font>

1419
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,459
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah. Come on!</font>

1420
01:45:37,243 --> 01:45:38,941
<font face="Serif" size="18">No.</font>

1421
01:45:39,115 --> 01:45:41,204
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, this isn't the way out.</font>

1422
01:45:41,378 --> 01:45:43,748
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes, it is. If we survive this, there'll be
another challenge and another</font>

1423
01:45:43,772 --> 01:45:45,730
<font face="Serif" size="18">until every last person
in that cage is dead.</font>

1424
01:45:45,904 --> 01:45:47,732
<font face="Serif" size="18">We have to find a work-around.</font>

1425
01:45:50,126 --> 01:45:52,215
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've got an idea. Follow me.</font>

1426
01:45:52,389 --> 01:45:53,695
<font face="Serif" size="18">No! Come back!</font>

1427
01:45:53,869 --> 01:45:56,132
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hey! What's your idea?</font>

1428
01:46:03,487 --> 01:46:05,097
<font face="Serif" size="18">When we hear the gong,
we jump in.</font>

1429
01:46:05,271 --> 01:46:06,490
<font face="Serif" size="18">Into this thing?</font>

1430
01:46:06,664 --> 01:46:08,536
<font face="Serif" size="18">You want to end up
like that guy?</font>

1431
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:10,886
<font face="Serif" size="18">We will only be inside
for a few seconds.</font>

1432
01:46:14,324 --> 01:46:16,413
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, If we're all inside,
who's gonna pull us out?</font>

1433
01:46:16,587 --> 01:46:18,589
<font face="Serif" size="18">- I will, trust me.
- Always.</font>

1434
01:46:18,763 --> 01:46:20,069
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hold.</font>

1435
01:46:23,289 --> 01:46:24,726
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hold.</font>

1436
01:46:26,771 --> 01:46:27,816
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hold!</font>

1437
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:30,079
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now!</font>

1438
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,506
<font face="Serif" size="18">Damn it! That stings!</font>

1439
01:47:16,386 --> 01:47:18,823
<font face="Serif" size="18">We got to move.</font>

1440
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:28,398
<font face="Serif" size="18">I've been here.</font>

1441
01:47:29,051 --> 01:47:30,356
<font face="Serif" size="18">Our gear.</font>

1442
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:35,927
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon. Try these
on your cuff.</font>

1443
01:47:38,277 --> 01:47:39,627
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come with me.</font>

1444
01:47:41,237 --> 01:47:43,152
<font face="Serif" size="18">Quite a second date, yeah?</font>

1445
01:47:57,166 --> 01:47:59,081
<font face="Serif" size="18">- A trip?
- Yes.</font>

1446
01:47:59,255 --> 01:48:01,538
<font face="Serif" size="18">Something urgent has come up, but
if we leave now we'll be safe.</font>

1447
01:48:01,562 --> 01:48:02,563
<font face="Serif" size="18">Safe from what?</font>

1448
01:48:04,782 --> 01:48:07,306
<font face="Serif" size="18">What is this? This is an ambush.</font>

1449
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:09,801
<font face="Serif" size="18">On the boat you were gonna use
to escape from Never winter.</font>

1450
01:48:09,874 --> 01:48:11,310
<font face="Serif" size="18">Dad. Hi, honey.</font>

1451
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,791
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hey, Forge, why don't you
tell her what this is?</font>

1452
01:48:15,314 --> 01:48:18,187
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't know. It's the
Tablet of Reawakening, Kira.</font>

1453
01:48:18,361 --> 01:48:20,276
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's the reason why I left you.</font>

1454
01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:22,408
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your dad's been
telling you the truth, Bug.</font>

1455
01:48:22,583 --> 01:48:25,063
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's Uncle Forge
who's been feeding you lies.</font>

1456
01:48:26,891 --> 01:48:29,198
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's rubbish.
It's just rubbish!</font>

1457
01:48:29,372 --> 01:48:30,852
<font face="Serif" size="18">Come with me, Kir.</font>

1458
01:48:31,809 --> 01:48:34,072
<font face="Serif" size="18">We'll go home, bring back Mom.</font>

1459
01:48:35,247 --> 01:48:37,206
<font face="Serif" size="18">We can be a family again.</font>

1460
01:48:40,905 --> 01:48:42,211
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're not taking my money.</font>

1461
01:48:44,082 --> 01:48:46,432
<font face="Serif" size="18">Put down the tablet and get off
my ship, all of you.</font>

1462
01:48:46,607 --> 01:48:48,652
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now! Okay. Okay. Okay.</font>

1463
01:48:48,826 --> 01:48:50,175
<font face="Serif" size="18">What are you doing?</font>

1464
01:48:50,349 --> 01:48:51,849
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's all right.
Shush, my darling, be quiet.</font>

1465
01:48:51,873 --> 01:48:53,570
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's going down.
Just don't hurt her.</font>

1466
01:48:53,744 --> 01:48:55,137
<font face="Serif" size="18">See that, Kira?</font>

1467
01:48:55,311 --> 01:48:57,269
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your father knows me.</font>

1468
01:48:57,443 --> 01:49:00,490
<font face="Serif" size="18">He knows I'm prepared
to do terrible things</font>

1469
01:49:00,664 --> 01:49:02,057
<font face="Serif" size="18">to get what I want.</font>

1470
01:49:02,884 --> 01:49:05,582
<font face="Serif" size="18">Even to those I care about most.</font>

1471
01:49:07,366 --> 01:49:10,848
<font face="Serif" size="18">In the end, that's all
that separates the beggar...</font>

1472
01:49:23,774 --> 01:49:25,559
<font face="Serif" size="18">Nobody hurts my Bug.</font>

1473
01:49:27,604 --> 01:49:29,171
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon, get us out of here!</font>

1474
01:49:36,657 --> 01:49:38,049
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sorry, Ed.</font>

1475
01:49:43,098 --> 01:49:44,403
<font face="Serif" size="18">Sorry, Forge!</font>

1476
01:49:59,027 --> 01:50:00,681
<font face="Serif" size="18">What's that one on about? Who knows?</font>

1477
01:50:00,855 --> 01:50:02,508
<font face="Serif" size="18">Twenty thousand
on the Gray Hands!</font>

1478
01:50:08,645 --> 01:50:10,342
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm sorry I believed him.</font>

1479
01:50:11,779 --> 01:50:13,650
<font face="Serif" size="18">What? What are you
talking about?</font>

1480
01:50:13,824 --> 01:50:16,784
<font face="Serif" size="18">You have nothing
to apologize for.</font>

1481
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:19,874
<font face="Serif" size="18">I should have done
so many things differently.</font>

1482
01:50:21,179 --> 01:50:24,443
<font face="Serif" size="18">I had a whole apology,
but I sort of gave it to Sofina.</font>

1483
01:50:25,793 --> 01:50:27,838
<font face="Serif" size="18">I love you, Kir.</font>

1484
01:50:28,012 --> 01:50:31,189
<font face="Serif" size="18">And nothing will ever get in
the way of that again, okay?</font>

1485
01:50:31,712 --> 01:50:32,713
<font face="Serif" size="18">Promise.</font>

1486
01:50:38,153 --> 01:50:40,329
<font face="Serif" size="18">I love you too, Dad.</font>

1487
01:50:40,503 --> 01:50:42,940
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's good to have you back, kid.</font>

1488
01:50:43,114 --> 01:50:45,943
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do you know how much loot
is on this ship?</font>

1489
01:50:47,815 --> 01:50:49,227
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm surprised
the boat can float.</font>

1490
01:50:49,251 --> 01:50:52,384
<font face="Serif" size="18">All right. So, we're gonna
need to lay low.</font>

1491
01:50:53,037 --> 01:50:54,517
<font face="Serif" size="18">What is that?</font>

1492
01:51:07,443 --> 01:51:09,358
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's the Beckoning Death.</font>

1493
01:51:09,532 --> 01:51:11,882
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's why she needed Forge.</font>

1494
01:51:12,056 --> 01:51:14,668
<font face="Serif" size="18">The games brought the city
together for the spell.</font>

1495
01:51:15,581 --> 01:51:17,888
<font face="Serif" size="18">Szass Tam is taking Never winter.</font>

1496
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:29,421
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, shit.</font>

1497
01:51:38,517 --> 01:51:40,519
<font face="Serif" size="18">So what do we do
when we get there?</font>

1498
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:44,045
<font face="Serif" size="18">Working on it. Simon, what did you say
the range was in that portal staff?</font>

1499
01:51:44,219 --> 01:51:46,047
<font face="Serif" size="18">A quarter mile. Why?</font>

1500
01:51:47,178 --> 01:51:49,920
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm gonna keep that promise
I made to Xenk.</font>

1501
01:51:58,537 --> 01:52:00,670
<font face="Serif" size="18">Whatever that is,
stop it. Now!</font>

1502
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,110
<font face="Serif" size="18">Look! She's Thayan!</font>

1503
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,245
<font face="Serif" size="18">Please! Please stop!</font>

1504
01:52:31,527 --> 01:52:34,486
<font face="Serif" size="18">You there! Harbor master person.
Are you seeing this?</font>

1505
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:37,228
<font face="Serif" size="18">As Lord of Never winter,
I demand a ship and crew</font>

1506
01:52:37,402 --> 01:52:39,578
<font face="Serif" size="18">to chase down
five people who have...</font>

1507
01:52:46,324 --> 01:52:48,500
<font face="Serif" size="18">What is this? No!</font>

1508
01:52:58,815 --> 01:53:01,035
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's the gift Forge promised!</font>

1509
01:53:20,402 --> 01:53:22,099
<font face="Serif" size="18">No! No! No!</font>

1510
01:53:22,273 --> 01:53:24,798
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, no, no! No! No!</font>

1511
01:53:24,972 --> 01:53:26,800
<font face="Serif" size="18">No!</font>

1512
01:53:28,497 --> 01:53:30,281
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's for you.
Enjoy that.</font>

1513
01:53:31,152 --> 01:53:32,153
<font face="Serif" size="18">All right.</font>

1514
01:53:33,154 --> 01:53:35,069
<font face="Serif" size="18">This isn't over until
we take her out.</font>

1515
01:53:36,026 --> 01:53:38,420
<font face="Serif" size="18">Whatever happens to us,
stay hidden.</font>

1516
01:53:39,073 --> 01:53:40,335
<font face="Serif" size="18">Use your pendant.</font>

1517
01:53:51,172 --> 01:53:53,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">Where do you think she's gone?</font>

1518
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:33,997
<font face="Serif" size="18">She missed.</font>

1519
01:55:49,159 --> 01:55:50,378
<font face="Serif" size="18">You all right?</font>

1520
01:56:08,222 --> 01:56:09,788
<font face="Serif" size="18">What do we do
when we get to her?</font>

1521
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:11,181
<font face="Serif" size="18">I got this.</font>

1522
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:18,596
<font face="Serif" size="18">You know not
the scope of my power!</font>

1523
01:57:35,483 --> 01:57:37,137
<font face="Serif" size="18">Enough!</font>

1524
01:57:40,270 --> 01:57:42,011
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's another Time Stop!</font>

1525
01:57:42,185 --> 01:57:45,232
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon, can you counter it? I can't.
She's still too strong!</font>

1526
01:57:45,884 --> 01:57:47,147
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm so sorr...</font>

1527
01:57:51,455 --> 01:57:53,240
<font face="Serif" size="18">For too long</font>

1528
01:57:53,414 --> 01:57:56,721
<font face="Serif" size="18">I endured the arrogance
of Forge Fitzwilliam.</font>

1529
01:57:56,895 --> 01:57:58,767
<font face="Serif" size="18">The false charm.</font>

1530
01:57:58,941 --> 01:58:01,204
<font face="Serif" size="18">The quips.</font>

1531
01:58:01,378 --> 01:58:04,077
<font face="Serif" size="18">And just as I begin
to purge this place</font>

1532
01:58:04,251 --> 01:58:08,385
<font face="Serif" size="18">of its living filth,
you dare interpose.</font>

1533
01:58:12,128 --> 01:58:15,392
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, as you die,</font>

1534
01:58:15,566 --> 01:58:18,003
<font face="Serif" size="18">rest assured
it will not be the end.</font>

1535
01:58:18,787 --> 01:58:23,357
<font face="Serif" size="18">For you will forever suffer.</font>

1536
01:58:25,663 --> 01:58:29,102
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm sorry, your breath
just smells like... old clothes.</font>

1537
01:58:29,276 --> 01:58:30,712
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's bad.</font>

1538
01:58:35,543 --> 01:58:36,761
<font face="Serif" size="18">What is this?</font>

1539
01:58:36,935 --> 01:58:39,721
<font face="Serif" size="18">I countered your Time Stop.
I got better.</font>

1540
01:58:39,895 --> 01:58:42,680
<font face="Serif" size="18">We had to distract you
so Kira could slap on that cuff</font>

1541
01:58:42,854 --> 01:58:44,682
<font face="Serif" size="18">and so Doric could do this.</font>

1542
01:58:50,862 --> 01:58:52,516
<font face="Serif" size="18">I think you got her.</font>

1543
01:59:05,094 --> 01:59:07,879
<font face="Serif" size="18">I honestly didn't think
that plan was gonna work.</font>

1544
01:59:08,576 --> 01:59:10,317
<font face="Serif" size="18">You assured us it would.</font>

1545
01:59:10,491 --> 01:59:12,188
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hey, Holga!</font>

1546
01:59:16,105 --> 01:59:18,063
<font face="Serif" size="18">Did we get her? Holga?</font>

1547
01:59:19,021 --> 01:59:21,980
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah.
Yeah, we got her.</font>

1548
01:59:22,807 --> 01:59:24,113
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, that's... Oh, God.</font>

1549
01:59:24,287 --> 01:59:25,636
<font face="Serif" size="18">That's not a good spot, is it?</font>

1550
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:27,812
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, it's not... it's not bad.</font>

1551
01:59:28,987 --> 01:59:29,987
<font face="Serif" size="18">Here.</font>

1552
01:59:30,075 --> 01:59:32,121
<font face="Serif" size="18">Simon! Simon, help her.</font>

1553
01:59:33,383 --> 01:59:36,734
<font face="Serif" size="18">It's a Red Wizard's blade.
There's nothing I can do.</font>

1554
01:59:39,346 --> 01:59:41,043
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hey. Hey.</font>

1555
01:59:41,217 --> 01:59:42,934
<font face="Serif" size="18">We're gonna patch you up.
It's not gonna be a problem.</font>

1556
01:59:42,958 --> 01:59:44,133
<font face="Serif" size="18">Please don't go.</font>

1557
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:46,831
<font face="Serif" size="18">Easy, Bug, easy. Please don't go.</font>

1558
01:59:47,005 --> 01:59:48,224
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don't mourn me.</font>

1559
01:59:48,398 --> 01:59:50,444
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, no, no. No final words.</font>

1560
01:59:50,618 --> 01:59:53,142
<font face="Serif" size="18">No final words. I'm
proud of what I did here.</font>

1561
01:59:53,316 --> 01:59:55,405
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm dying a hero.</font>

1562
01:59:56,711 --> 01:59:58,321
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you...</font>

1563
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:01,846
<font face="Serif" size="18">You're a good man.</font>

1564
02:00:02,499 --> 02:00:04,022
<font face="Serif" size="18">A real Harper.</font>

1565
02:00:05,023 --> 02:00:07,200
<font face="Serif" size="18">Shut up. I'm a moron,
you know that.</font>

1566
02:00:07,852 --> 02:00:09,332
<font face="Serif" size="18">Promise me something.</font>

1567
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:11,595
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, anything.</font>

1568
02:00:11,769 --> 02:00:14,424
<font face="Serif" size="18">That you're gonna take
good care of our girl.</font>

1569
02:00:15,773 --> 02:00:18,211
<font face="Serif" size="18">She's the best thing
you ever did.</font>

1570
02:00:19,995 --> 02:00:21,431
<font face="Serif" size="18">I will.</font>

1571
02:00:50,373 --> 02:00:51,548
<font face="Serif" size="18">No.</font>

1572
02:00:52,854 --> 02:00:54,072
<font face="Serif" size="18">No!</font>

1573
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,901
<font face="Serif" size="18">I need you.</font>

1574
02:00:59,034 --> 02:01:01,515
<font face="Serif" size="18">I need you.</font>

1575
02:01:58,267 --> 02:02:00,617
<font face="Serif" size="18">We can only use it once.</font>

1576
02:02:04,099 --> 02:02:05,143
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know.</font>

1577
02:02:13,804 --> 02:02:14,936
<font face="Serif" size="18">Holga Kilgore.</font>

1578
02:02:31,735 --> 02:02:34,521
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don't tell me
you wasted it on me.</font>

1579
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:37,785
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why would you do that?</font>

1580
02:03:00,285 --> 02:03:02,853
<font face="Serif" size="18">Szass Tam won't
be happy about this.</font>

1581
02:03:03,027 --> 02:03:04,725
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, if he comes after us,
we'll be ready.</font>

1582
02:03:04,899 --> 02:03:06,553
<font face="Serif" size="18">We?</font>

1583
02:03:06,727 --> 02:03:08,685
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, that's right. You
don't like humans, do you?</font>

1584
02:03:10,992 --> 02:03:12,123
<font face="Serif" size="18">Some are okay.</font>

1585
02:03:13,951 --> 02:03:15,562
<font face="Serif" size="18">What about you? Hmm?</font>

1586
02:03:15,736 --> 02:03:18,608
<font face="Serif" size="18">Going back to the Harpers?
Be with your people?</font>

1587
02:03:20,305 --> 02:03:21,916
<font face="Serif" size="18">I'm with my people.</font>

1588
02:03:24,092 --> 02:03:25,833
<font face="Serif" size="18">So, uh,</font>

1589
02:03:26,007 --> 02:03:30,228
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know my last attempt to court
you was quite bad.</font>

1590
02:03:30,403 --> 02:03:34,102
<font face="Serif" size="18">But I wonder if you'd consider
having another go at it?</font>

1591
02:03:36,713 --> 02:03:37,845
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yeah, all right. Yeah?</font>

1592
02:03:38,019 --> 02:03:39,760
<font face="Serif" size="18">Calm down.Right.</font>

1593
02:03:47,768 --> 02:03:50,161
<font face="Serif" size="18">Damn! Bloody chalice.</font>

1594
02:04:08,745 --> 02:04:10,051
<font face="Serif" size="18">Good evening.</font>

1595
02:04:11,574 --> 02:04:13,837
<font face="Serif" size="18">Of course, you know
what happened after that.</font>

1596
02:04:14,011 --> 02:04:15,926
<font face="Serif" size="18">With Sofina's magic expunged,</font>

1597
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,059
<font face="Serif" size="18">Lord Neverember finally came to.</font>

1598
02:04:20,235 --> 02:04:22,237
<font face="Serif" size="18">His first official act
was to award</font>

1599
02:04:22,411 --> 02:04:25,370
<font face="Serif" size="18">the saviors of Never winter
the Medal of Heroism.</font>

1600
02:04:26,415 --> 02:04:28,112
<font face="Serif" size="18">And to the Emerald Enclave,</font>

1601
02:04:28,286 --> 02:04:31,768
<font face="Serif" size="18">he granted formal protection
of their people and their land.</font>

1602
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:41,212
<font face="Serif" size="18">One could argue that my actions,
reprehensible though they were,</font>

1603
02:04:41,386 --> 02:04:43,998
<font face="Serif" size="18">led to a virtual renaissance
for the city.</font>

1604
02:04:44,172 --> 02:04:47,567
<font face="Serif" size="18">And while I've only served the first
year of my sentence, I have to say,</font>

1605
02:04:47,741 --> 02:04:49,003
<font face="Serif" size="18">it has been</font>

1606
02:04:50,134 --> 02:04:51,484
<font face="Serif" size="18">eye-opening.</font>

1607
02:04:52,572 --> 02:04:55,052
<font face="Serif" size="18">I have taken a look inside</font>

1608
02:04:55,749 --> 02:04:57,402
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I've asked myself,</font>

1609
02:04:58,447 --> 02:04:59,840
<font face="Serif" size="18">'What's going on in there?'</font>

1610
02:05:01,189 --> 02:05:06,411
<font face="Serif" size="18">And, you know, I realized
a lot of it goes back to my mum.</font>

1611
02:05:07,674 --> 02:05:10,241
<font face="Serif" size="18">She was a stern woman,
prone to fits of...</font>

1612
02:05:10,415 --> 02:05:12,505
<font face="Serif" size="18">Stop, stop!
We've heard enough.</font>

1613
02:05:14,245 --> 02:05:16,117
<font face="Serif" size="18">Pardon denied.</font>

1614
02:05:16,291 --> 02:05:18,728
<font face="Serif" size="18">This session is adjourned.</font>

1615
02:05:23,646 --> 02:05:24,647

1616
02:05:30,261 --> 02:05:32,394
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, no! I'm terribly sorry.</font>

1617
02:05:32,568 --> 02:05:35,484
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don't know what came over me,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!</font>

1618
02:07:47,311 --> 02:07:48,486
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hello?</font>

1619
02:07:50,097 --> 02:07:53,143
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can somebody please
ask me another question?</font>

1620
02:07:54,579 --> 02:07:55,624
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anyone?</font>
