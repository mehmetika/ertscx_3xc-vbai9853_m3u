WEBVTT

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.058
Where did you find that?

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.438
Did I say you could wear
my old things?

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:12.943
Take it off!

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.112
Get down to the barn and
feed the animals,

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.781
like you promised you would.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.136
Eat up!

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.104
One day you'll never
see me again.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.982
That's right, Charlie.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.152
The farm life may be it for you,

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.945
but it sure ain't for me.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.949
I'm special.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:04.578
Mama's gonna feel real stupid
when she finds out, won't she?

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:16.423
One day, the whole world's
gonna know my name.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.177
You agree, don't you, Mary?

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:24.097
Oh. Why, thank you.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.818
I do love a good audience.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.659
Y'all see me
for who I really am.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.751
A star.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.721
What are you doing in here,
Mr. Goose?

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.645
Theda!

00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.901
Go on, girl.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.121
Take it.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:41.568
You aren't to indulge
in any more such foolishness.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.737
It's just dancing, Mama.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.031
It's selfish is what it is.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.657
With all the farmhands gone,

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.035
I can't do everything
around here myself.

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:55.165
I help.

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.586
Pack the corn in the pot

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.588
and go fetch your father.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.682
Anything for
me in the post today?

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:13.892
No.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.400
It says the Allies
have taken control of France.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.277
You can read it after supper.

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.363
But, Mama, this could
mean the end of the war!

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.531
Do as I ask, Pearl.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:31.910
I don't want to hear about any
more dead Germans tonight.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.339
Supper's ready, Daddy.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:52.097
Bless us, O' Lord,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.182
and these thy gifts
which we are about

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.892
to receive from thy bounty

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:59.396
through Christ
our Lord. Amen.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:00.563
Amen.

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:20.000
Help your father.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.439
"My precious Pearl.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:46.401
"It feels as if it has been
an eternity without you.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.319
"All we do is walk, it seems.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.823
"I never know if we'll get to
where they say we're going.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.284
"They have us chew
on bouillon cubes

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.244
"so we don't notice
the pains in our feet.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:59.956
"I find it most frightening
at night in the trenches.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.416
“The mortar shells
are deafening.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:04.627
"Many soldiers have
gone mad with the fear.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.837
"Carnage from the gas

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.964
"has shown me things
I won't soon forget,

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.216
"and thinking of you
has been my only reprieve.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.303
"I will always be proud
to serve my country,

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.555
"but one thing
this war has made clear

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.807
"is that I cannot wait
to return home

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.225
"and begin our life together.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.978
"I never want to be away
from you again.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.813
"Till death do us part.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.858
"Your loving husband,
Howard."

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.792
I'll go to town tomorrow.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.921
Pick up more medicine.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.762
Which means I get to
stop by the pictures.

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.433
Just don't tell Mama.

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:03.937
They show all the best
dancers at the pictures.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.694
I could be on the line
with those girls one day.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.156
I know I could.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.879
Pearl.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.800
I didn't want to waste
the hot water.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.889
The money for his medicine
is on the kitchen table.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:47.063
Remember to cover your face.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.232
And don't linger close
to anyone.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.819
Papers are warning
of a lethal resurgence.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:56.072
God forbid sickness
returns to our home.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.185
The time is now...

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.610
Two-bits, please.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.584
Did you enjoy the picture?

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:21.050
Cigarette?

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.095
Oh, go on.
I don't have the bug.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:31.894
You like the movies?

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.022
I like dancing.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.274
Oh, a future Tiller Girl.

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:37.567
I can see it now.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.569
I wish.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.112
Why not?
You're pretty enough.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.285
On account of a husband,
I gather?

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.287
He's overseas,

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:54.167
but my father's infirmed,
so I have to help at home.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.585
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.546
You want to come
watch the second show?

00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:01.299
Free admission.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.553
I'm the projectionist.

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.975
I need to get going.

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:14.479
Mama's expecting me,
but I appreciate the, um...

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.202
Stay there for just
one minute, would you?

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.442
Okay.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.338
From what you just saw.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.965
Aren't you showing it again?

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.467
Ah... Sure,
but it's only one frame.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.636
Nobody will notice once
I splice it back together.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:47.863
You know, caring for your family

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.156
during these times is admirable.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.807
You ought to take pride in that,

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.059
but don't forget to live
your life, too.

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:54.182
I wouldn't mind seeing you

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.646
up on that screen
one day, missus...

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:58.564
Pearl.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.111
Well, if you come back,

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.321
knock on this door.
I'm always here, and,

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.657
well, I can run the pictures
as much as I like.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.283
Thank you.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.243
I will.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.561
May I have this dance?

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.523
I'm married!

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.330
Shh...

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.154
What took you so long?

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.905
It's a far ride, Mama.

00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:43.659
What is on your head?

00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:47.371
Found it along the road.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.207
Do not bring it inside.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.126
It may be covered in germs.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:57.089
Wash your hair.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.133
If you're lucky,
it's only full of lice.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:02.845
When you finish,
your father needs changing.

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:05.514
Don't let him sit in his mess.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.190
I saw a new picture today.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:17.526
You'd have liked it.
The girls were all flawless.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.570
There's no room
for even the tiniest

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:22.698
lack of precision
in a troupe like that.

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.867
It takes absolute perfection.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.245
What a charmed life it must
be to star in the movies.

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:23.968
Are you still in there?

00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:00.379
Bless us, O' Lord,
and these thy gifts

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:03.591
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty

00:23:03.674 --> 00:23:06.802
through Christ
our Lord. Amen.

00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:07.928
Amen.

00:23:21.609 --> 00:23:23.819
Where is the rest of
the money I lent you?

00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:28.824
- There was none.
- I can count, Pearl.

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.118
There are eight cents missing.

00:23:32.453 --> 00:23:35.456
I may have gotten some
hard candy for the trip home.

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:42.254
That is enough, then.

00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:44.506
You ate the candy,
that was your supper.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.594
The food I worked hard
to prepare alone is not.

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:52.681
But, Mama, I rode all
that way. I'm starving.

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:55.142
You may have what's left
of it in the morning.

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:01.690
- Where are you going?
- To bed!

00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:04.276
I did not excuse you
from the table.

00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:06.987
Sit down!

00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:19.124
We don't have much money to feed
ourselves in this house.

00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:21.710
Times have changed, Pearl.

00:24:22.878 --> 00:24:25.422
You cannot be so careless.

00:24:25.506 --> 00:24:31.720
It is up to you and I, and only
you and I, to survive.

00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:35.975
You have seen the way people
treat German farmers.

00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:38.143
The only reason we are not
sick or famished

00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:42.773
is because we are mindful of the
way we conduct our lives.

00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:44.942
I know that.

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:46.276
And I am careful.

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:49.405
I won't allow you to wander

00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:51.448
around in foolish fantasies

00:24:51.532 --> 00:24:54.535
and hide from your
responsibilities any longer.

00:24:54.618 --> 00:24:56.578
It is a sign of weakness.

00:24:56.662 --> 00:25:01.166
And your father and I did
not raise you to be weak.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.419
Is that clear?

00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:06.588
Good.

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:07.952
Then you can
leave the table now.

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:26.942
Please, Lord,

00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:30.529
make me the biggest star
the world has ever known

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:34.575
so that I may get far,
far away from this place.

00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:39.663
Amen.

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:52.444
Afternoon, Pearl!

00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:55.531
Hi, Mitsy!
I like your dress.

00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:58.117
Oh, thank you.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.119
It feels wonderful
to finally be able to

00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:02.037
don something pretty again.

00:27:02.121 --> 00:27:04.081
It's the first time
we've left home in weeks.

00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:06.500
Mother is so afraid
of getting ill.

00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:07.751
Mama, too.

00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:09.044
Well, we were a bit worried

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:11.463
about the both of you
being out here all alone,

00:27:11.547 --> 00:27:13.507
so we brought some food.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.008
That's very kind.

00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:16.593
How have you been getting on?

00:27:17.386 --> 00:27:19.388
Any new letters from Howard?

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.973
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, well...

00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:23.684
Mother has been
riddled with worry.

00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:26.436
They say no news
is good news, though.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.147
If only his pride
hadn't gotten him

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.357
involved in this dreadful war.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.441
You know we had a doctor

00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:33.443
willing to declare him
ineligible?

00:27:33.527 --> 00:27:35.737
Anyone would've taken
that opportunity.

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:36.738
Not Howard.

00:27:36.822 --> 00:27:39.366
First, he runs off
to become a farmer.

00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:40.742
Now, the army.

00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:44.746
The lengths my brother will go
to just to spite his father.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.415
All this isolation
has been enough

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:48.375
to make one mad, hasn't it?

00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:50.836
It really has.

00:27:50.919 --> 00:27:53.088
No, we don't accept charity.

00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:55.841
Oh, for God's sake, Ruth.
It's just a pig.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:01.847
Can I share
a secret with you, Pearl?

00:28:05.976 --> 00:28:07.436
Mother would throttle me

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.688
if she knew I was
planning on attending.

00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:12.983
But there's a dance audition
this Saturday at our church

00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:14.776
for a Christmas chorus line

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:15.940
to bring merriment to folks

00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:17.946
throughout the state
during the holidays.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.866
Word is, they're putting
together a troupe

00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:23.160
and will be touring
seven different cities

00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:24.328
before the year ends.

00:28:24.411 --> 00:28:26.121
Don't that sound exciting?

00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:28.665
I would love so much
to be a part of it.

00:28:28.749 --> 00:28:29.917
So would I.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.960
We should go together then.

00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:34.755
But you can't tell a soul.

00:28:34.838 --> 00:28:36.048
I would never.

00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:38.467
Splendid.
It'll be our secret.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.052
Mitsy!

00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:41.803
I better skedaddle.

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:45.057
We got three more pigs
to drop off this afternoon.

00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:48.477
Saturday at 11:00.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.853
Okay.

00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:51.897
Sister-in-laws have to
stick together, right?

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.982
Mitsy!

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:56.526
- Time to go!
- See you later, Pearl.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.821
Bye, Mitsy!

00:29:04.868 --> 00:29:07.496
Charlie, this could be it.

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:23.488
Pearl?

00:30:33.332 --> 00:30:34.583
Pearl!

00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:15.434
Well,

00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:17.811
I didn't expect to see you
again this soon.

00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:38.874
Have a seat.

00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:50.844
I can't believe you get to see

00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:53.013
the pictures every day for free.

00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:54.806
Yeah, not a bad gig, huh?

00:32:59.769 --> 00:33:01.897
Thank you.

00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:05.442
So, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

00:33:07.444 --> 00:33:08.737
I've been thinking a lot about

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.280
what you said to me
the other day

00:33:10.363 --> 00:33:12.491
about not forgetting
to live my life,

00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:14.409
and, well,

00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:17.412
there's a dance audition
coming up at the church.

00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:19.080
Oh, I like the sound of that.

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.917
So do I...

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.961
But I've never really danced
in front of anyone before.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.632
What if I'm not perfect?

00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:31.009
You can do anything
if you want it bad enough.

00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:34.596
I want it.

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.932
Then don't let anything
stand in your way.

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:40.810
What would you like to see?

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.687
Palace Follies.

00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:45.524
Oh, come on.
You saw that already.

00:33:45.607 --> 00:33:47.084
How about something
different tonight?

00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:48.401
How about...

00:33:51.905 --> 00:33:55.116
How about a film
nobody else has seen?

00:33:55.534 --> 00:33:56.534
Okay.

00:33:58.078 --> 00:33:59.118
I picked this one up while

00:33:59.162 --> 00:34:00.914
I was in the service in France.

00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:08.213
Do you live in here?

00:34:10.549 --> 00:34:13.969
I lay my head on that pillow
from time to time,

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:16.805
but I wouldn't say I live
anywhere in particular.

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:20.684
I'm what more civilized people
refer to as bohemian.

00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:23.353
I don't know what that is.

00:34:23.436 --> 00:34:26.815
It means I can pack up
and leave whenever I want to.

00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:29.401
Sounds like a dream.

00:34:29.484 --> 00:34:32.320
Just as long
as I can keep from waking up.

00:34:57.887 --> 00:34:59.681
What is this?

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:01.266
Just watch.

00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:36.259
Never seen anything like
that before now, have you?

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:40.055
There are all kinds of
underground stag films

00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:41.431
like this out there.

00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:44.392
Is it legal?

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:47.187
Doing it, yeah.

00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:49.814
Filming it, no.

00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:53.902
Not here, anyway.
It will be eventually.

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:57.489
People would pay an arm
and a leg to see this.

00:35:57.572 --> 00:36:00.075
Pictures like this are going
to revolutionize the industry

00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:03.662
and I, for one, plan on
capitalizing early.

00:36:04.788 --> 00:36:06.748
It's reality.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.876
There's no denying
we all share a fascination

00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:12.921
in seeing people
as they truly are.

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:15.715
I don't like reality.

00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:21.054
Where I live, I mean.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.139
So leave.

00:36:31.064 --> 00:36:32.774
It's not that easy.

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:33.858
Well, sure it is.

00:36:33.942 --> 00:36:35.169
There's a road
right out front there

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:37.028
that'll take you all the
way to New York City.

00:36:38.655 --> 00:36:41.241
One day my mother and father
will be gone.

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.828
I can do what I want then.

00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:46.413
What if that's too late?

00:36:47.997 --> 00:36:49.833
The fact and truth
of the matter is, Pearl,

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.044
you only get
one take at this life.

00:36:53.128 --> 00:36:55.630
And if you don't make the
most of it when you're young,

00:36:55.714 --> 00:36:57.590
you don't get a second chance.

00:37:00.593 --> 00:37:02.846
If only they would just die.

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:08.226
Pardon?

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:12.772
Nothing.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:20.572
It's real nice to be able to
talk to someone for a change.

00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:23.032
Been cooped up
on that farm for so long

00:37:23.116 --> 00:37:25.118
sometimes I worry that maybe

00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:27.787
I'm not the same
as other people.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.000
Why would you ever want to
be like everybody else?

00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:35.003
I don't know.

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:40.550
Sometimes it just seems
more peaceful, I guess.

00:37:51.436 --> 00:37:53.396
Did you mean what you said?

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.899
About wanting to see me
up on that screen?

00:37:57.484 --> 00:37:58.735
Sure, I did.

00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:01.654
I'd do anything to be up there.

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:04.741
Well, then,
you ought to go overseas

00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:06.409
when this pandemic ends.

00:38:06.493 --> 00:38:07.869
That's what I'm doing.

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.330
The arts are so much more
alive in Europe.

00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:12.457
You can be whoever
you want to be there.

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:14.793
Really?

00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:16.711
You could even be
in pictures like this.

00:38:17.921 --> 00:38:19.255
I know I'd watch you.

00:38:25.804 --> 00:38:27.222
I should go now.

00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:32.060
Thank you.

00:38:33.102 --> 00:38:34.604
What for?

00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:36.147
For seeing me tonight.

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:03.192
What are you staring at?

00:40:45.902 --> 00:40:47.445
Theda!

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.040
I'm leaving soon.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.798
I can't stay here any longer.

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:10.635
Howard was supposed
to take me away.

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.430
It'd be easier for me

00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:17.058
if I didn't feel like
I was abandoning you.

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.436
You understand that?

00:41:26.442 --> 00:41:29.487
I love you, Daddy, but
this is no way to live.

00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:34.909
Pearl?

00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:38.204
What are you doing?

00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:41.708
Talking with Daddy.

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:47.171
We need to get him
back to the house.

00:41:50.258 --> 00:41:51.843
Why do you hate me, Mama?

00:41:55.638 --> 00:41:57.640
I only want what's best.

00:42:00.393 --> 00:42:02.103
When do I get what I want?

00:42:05.565 --> 00:42:06.733
One day you'll understand

00:42:06.816 --> 00:42:09.736
that getting what you want
isn't what's important.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.198
Making the most
of what you have is.

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:18.411
Life rarely turns out
how you expect.

00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:19.829
You need to be prepared for that

00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:21.664
if you ever want to be happy.

00:42:23.499 --> 00:42:24.792
Come back inside.

00:42:42.602 --> 00:42:44.228
Where are you?

00:43:58.344 --> 00:44:01.097
Stop staring at me.

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.368
How'd you find that?

00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:07.580
I am not blind to
what goes on around here.

00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:10.082
Take your dinner.
Stay in the bunkhouse.

00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:11.542
But it's freezing out there!

00:45:11.626 --> 00:45:14.337
You should've thought of that
before putting me at risk.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.506
Isolate yourself until
we know you're not ill.

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:18.966
That is what's right.

00:45:23.012 --> 00:45:25.640
There's a dance audition
in town tomorrow.

00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:30.478
I'm going to it.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.104
No, you're not.

00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:34.899
- Yes, I am.
- Why?

00:45:36.025 --> 00:45:37.985
Find out if I'm good enough.

00:45:38.903 --> 00:45:40.613
Good enough for what, Pearl?

00:45:45.534 --> 00:45:47.787
Something more than this.

00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:54.252
Where does all this
ungratefulness stem from?

00:45:54.335 --> 00:45:57.505
How is it you find our life
so beneath you?

00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:59.590
You've always had
a roof over your head,

00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:01.676
food in your belly.

00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:03.970
Do you not think that came
at great sacrifice

00:46:04.053 --> 00:46:05.846
from your father and 1?

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.016
Or do you think we are
beneath you, too?

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.851
If I'm meant to live out
the rest of my days

00:46:10.935 --> 00:46:12.687
with you and Daddy on this farm,

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:13.813
then so be it.

00:46:13.896 --> 00:46:16.315
But I'm only young once.

00:46:16.399 --> 00:46:19.318
If I go to this audition
and I don't get picked,

00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:20.528
then I'll come home

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:23.864
and I'll never speak
of it again, I swear.

00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:25.533
But I have to know that I tried

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:27.386
or I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.329
Please, Mama. You have no
idea what I'm capable of.

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:33.666
Oh, yes, I do.

00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:38.212
I've seen the things
you've done in private,

00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:40.881
when you believe
no one is watching.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.052
You think others won't notice?

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:48.723
You can't keep your true
self hidden forever, Pearl.

00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:52.018
They will notice eventually,
and they will be frightened,

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.353
just as I am.

00:46:55.938 --> 00:46:58.899
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

00:46:58.983 --> 00:47:03.029
Then what a fine
woman you hope to become,

00:47:03.112 --> 00:47:04.572
leaving your mother alone to rot

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:07.658
so you can dance with
a bunch of silly whores.

00:47:07.742 --> 00:47:10.536
Let alone the illness you may
contract and spread.

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:12.413
You've seen what it does
to your father.

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:14.498
That's what you want
for yourself and others?

00:47:14.582 --> 00:47:17.209
And maybe that is what
you wish for me.

00:47:17.293 --> 00:47:19.754
- Of course not.
- Stop lying!

00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:21.839
I can't stand
the sound of it anymore!

00:47:21.922 --> 00:47:25.509
It's almost as abhorrent
as your sinful behavior!

00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:28.596
You are not well, Pearl!

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:31.307
It's only a matter of time
before you hurt someone else.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:35.686
Malevolence is festering
in you, I see it.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.938
And I will not,
in good conscience,

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:39.940
let you leave this farm again.

00:47:41.108 --> 00:47:42.777
You can't stop me.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:44.278
Oh, yes, I can.

00:47:44.362 --> 00:47:47.156
You don't want to know
what I could do to you.

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:51.243
I shoulder a burden
you will never understand,

00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:53.204
spend my days feeding
and wiping the snot

00:47:53.287 --> 00:47:55.289
off the face of the man
I married.

00:47:55.373 --> 00:47:58.709
You dare sit there and
talk to me about regret?

00:47:58.793 --> 00:48:01.837
I was supposed to be his
wife, not his mother!

00:48:01.921 --> 00:48:04.632
Don't you ever speak
that way to me again!

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.175
Do you hear me?

00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:09.011
- I'm sorry.
- No! You're not!

00:48:09.095 --> 00:48:10.846
Or you would stop all this!

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.306
Here! Take it!

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.518
That's what you really
desire, isn't it?

00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:18.145
Perhaps I should
kill him for you?

00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:20.523
That way you don't have to
care for him any longer.

00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:23.567
Would that suit
your selfish dreams better?

00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:25.820
Then we can both
go to the dance audition!

00:48:25.903 --> 00:48:28.280
Your husband is gone.
So is mine.

00:48:28.364 --> 00:48:30.124
Why should we be saddled
with caring for them

00:48:30.199 --> 00:48:31.575
or the work of this farm?

00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:34.620
What about us
getting what we want?

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:44.797
I won't suffer for you
any longer.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.092
You want to leave? Go.

00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:49.677
But when you fail...

00:48:51.137 --> 00:48:52.847
And you will fail...

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.350
I want you to remember
what it feels like

00:48:57.518 --> 00:49:02.231
because that's how I feel
every time I look at you.

00:49:02.314 --> 00:49:06.652
Nearly everything I ever had
has been taken from me, Pearl.

00:49:08.904 --> 00:49:11.240
What more do you want?

00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:14.410
I just don't want to end up
like you, is all.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.008
I hate you!

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:32.511
You harlot!

00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:34.972
I won't let you flaunt
your arrogance in my face!

00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:38.100
- You are not better than me!
- Yes, I am!

00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:40.311
I'm going to be a star!

00:49:40.394 --> 00:49:43.147
The whole world
is going to know my name!

00:52:20.095 --> 00:52:22.640
Where are you going? It's
not even 6:00 a.m. yet.

00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:24.391
I have to practice my routine.

00:52:24.475 --> 00:52:27.102
I need to be perfect
for my audition today.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.066
You still think
I'm pretty enough?

00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.610
Oh, not much has changed
in the last 24 hours.

00:52:34.693 --> 00:52:36.028
Yes, it has.

00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:38.989
Oh. You forgot this
last time.

00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:42.368
I'm glad you came back.

00:52:45.204 --> 00:52:47.164
So am I.

00:52:52.544 --> 00:52:54.338
Let me at least drive you home.

00:53:07.476 --> 00:53:09.061
Somebody you know?

00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:13.941
I'm not really sure.

00:53:14.817 --> 00:53:16.819
Well...

00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:18.462
It's hard to know
who anyone is nowadays

00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:20.531
with all these masks
people are wearing.

00:53:51.395 --> 00:53:52.563
Wait here a minute.

00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:17.671
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

00:54:38.817 --> 00:54:40.819
I'm going to get you
cleaned up real soon, okay?

00:54:40.903 --> 00:54:42.196
I just have a guest right now.

00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:44.156
Shh!

00:54:56.335 --> 00:54:58.420
Ah. Ah.

00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:14.019
Okay, come in!

00:55:32.496 --> 00:55:33.580
This is my father.

00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:39.211
Pleased to meet you, sir.

00:55:47.386 --> 00:55:49.221
Want to go up to my bedroom now?

00:55:55.894 --> 00:55:58.063
I want off this farm forever.

00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:01.817
I don't know.
It doesn't seem so bad.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.778
It is.

00:56:05.821 --> 00:56:08.824
What was that?

00:56:08.907 --> 00:56:11.076
Nothing.

00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:13.745
Tell me more about Europe.

00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:15.789
When can we go?

00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:19.710
Don't you
think you should go check?

00:56:20.711 --> 00:56:21.837
No.

00:56:24.089 --> 00:56:25.674
All right.
I'm sorry.

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.134
Whatever that is,

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:28.802
we can't just ignore it.

00:56:28.886 --> 00:56:30.566
It could be your father,
for Christ's sake.

00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:32.306
It's not my father.

00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:35.309
Please don't go.

00:56:36.894 --> 00:56:38.020
What's the matter with you?

00:56:39.688 --> 00:56:41.106
Nothing.

00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:33.533
It's our dog.

00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:35.470
She made a mess in the
kitchen while I was away,

00:57:35.494 --> 00:57:36.954
so I put her in the root cellar.

00:57:39.748 --> 00:57:41.208
I want to show you something.

00:57:48.256 --> 00:57:49.716
That's Charlie!

00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:52.678
She's always hungry.

00:57:52.761 --> 00:57:55.138
We can't afford to feed her
like we used to.

00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:58.266
And over here, this is Mary.

00:57:58.350 --> 00:57:59.726
Ain't she a dish?

00:58:00.185 --> 00:58:01.478
Mmm.

00:58:02.396 --> 00:58:03.981
This is Francis.

00:58:05.065 --> 00:58:06.733
They're my best audience.

00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:10.654
I named each of them after
my favorite picture stars.

00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:14.157
I've put on so many shows
for them over the years.

00:58:14.241 --> 00:58:16.243
It'll be sad to say goodbye,
but like they say,

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.845
"If you're not moving forward
in show business,

00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:19.037
"you're moving backwards."

00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:22.165
We used to have
many more animals,

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:24.459
but they all died.

00:58:25.627 --> 00:58:27.087
What about your dog?

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:28.714
Huh?

00:58:28.797 --> 00:58:31.425
- What's its name?
- We don't have a dog.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:35.512
I thought you said you, uh, did?

00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:37.055
In the cellar?

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:39.349
Oh.

00:58:40.475 --> 00:58:44.354
Right. Yeah.

00:58:44.438 --> 00:58:48.567
Yeah, well, um...

00:58:49.526 --> 00:58:51.945
Oh, boy.

00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:54.322
Oh, I better be getting back,
you know?

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.452
- What?
- Oh, I've got to go

00:58:58.535 --> 00:58:59.679
and screen the matinee,
you know,

00:58:59.703 --> 00:59:01.121
but you gotta practice,
remember?

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:02.998
You gotta get those
dance moves perfect.

00:59:03.915 --> 00:59:04.915
Now's not the time to be

00:59:04.958 --> 00:59:06.668
resting on your laurels, is it?

00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:10.547
Nice seeing you, Pearl.

00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:16.303
Did I do something wrong?

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.388
No.

00:59:20.932 --> 00:59:23.393
Then why did you
just go cold on me?

00:59:25.604 --> 00:59:27.314
I don't know what you mean.

00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:29.524
What did you see?

00:59:30.734 --> 00:59:32.235
I didn't see anything.

00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:36.364
You're lying.

00:59:36.448 --> 00:59:38.700
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:43.246
I know because I feel
things very deeply.

00:59:44.664 --> 00:59:46.309
Look, I've got to get back
to work, all right?

00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:47.834
- I'll... I'll see you later.
- When?

00:59:47.918 --> 00:59:50.128
- What?
- When will I see you?

00:59:50.212 --> 00:59:51.481
I don't know, Pearl.
It's just an expression.

00:59:51.505 --> 00:59:52.815
You're not going to take
me to Europe, are you?

00:59:52.839 --> 00:59:53.882
Tell me the truth.

00:59:56.384 --> 00:59:57.677
What did I do wrong?

00:59:57.761 --> 00:59:59.054
- Nothing. Calm down.
- No!

00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.598
Why are you leaving me if I
didn't do anything wrong?

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.683
I don't understand!
I thought you liked me!

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:06.853
- I do like you. I just...
- Tell me the truth!

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.498
Why are you leaving me?
What did you see?

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:09.523
Why did you change?

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.483
You're scaring me, Pearl.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.860
Okay?

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:18.448
I wish you the best of luck
with your audition.

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:19.783
Sincerely.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.558
You're not gonna leave me here!

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.644
I'm not staying on this farm!

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:53.358
Nothing's going to keep me here!

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.411
You hear me?

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.539
Nothing!

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.128
Not you! Not Howard!

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.006
Not Mama! Nobody!

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.183
No. No.

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:47.913
I want you to remember
what it feels like.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.543
'Cause that's how I felt
every time you looked at me.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.968
Okay, Daddy.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.637
Let's get you cleaned up.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:37.003
I wish you wouldn't
look at me like that.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.122
What do you think?

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.571
Thank you for everything.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.992
I know you'll look down
on me proudly.

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.126
You are loved.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:21.983
Au revoir, poor Johnny!

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.777
Oh, thank goodness you came.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.862
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to show.

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:09.406
Sorry.

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:11.616
I had some chores to do
around the house.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:14.327
Well, I've been in such
a flap all by myself.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.995
I feel worse
than I imagine I would

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.331
had I contracted that awful flu.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.626
What's in the suitcases?

01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:23.962
All my things I need
for going on the road.

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:26.381
Wow.
You're confident.

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:31.761
Rumor has it they may only be
taking one gal per town.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.140
It has to be me.

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:41.521
I don't think you meant
to say that out loud, Pearl.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:44.858
Well, if it's not me, then I
hope it's you, right?

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:46.901
It has to be me.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:53.450
Next.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.589
That's Dorothy Collins.

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:12.886
Can't say I'm too
saddened for her.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:16.389
Some people just think
they're God's gift, you know?

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:19.434
But they always get what's
coming to them eventually.

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:24.856
I feel bad saying that,
actually.

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:26.858
She's a nurse.

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:29.360
I don't know how to do
something like that.

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:31.613
Oh, Pearl.
I'm so nervous.

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:33.448
What if they laugh me
right off stage?

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:35.450
I don't think
I could handle that.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.496
How are you not scared?

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:44.375
I guess I'm just more
used to the feeling.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:51.174
Next.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:08.733
Oh, Lord.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.452
Switch places with me.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.746
I don't think I can do this.
I'm too frightened.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:23.581
- What?
- Come on, Pearl.

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:26.376
Switch before they open
the doors again.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.629
Come on. Move.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:36.177
Thank you.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:38.596
You're a good friend.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:44.978
Am I?

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.648
Of course you are.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:57.407
Sister-in-laws have to
stick together, right?

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:26.978
Next.

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:29.522
Your turn, Pearl.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.150
Time to show them
what you can do.

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:33.818
I'm gonna show them all.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:36.029
Break a leg.

01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:40.677
Ready, miss?

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.254
Thank you.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.674
But it's gonna be a no.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.400
Pardon?

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:04.570
Sorry, you're just not
what we had in mind.

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:16.123
Well, that was the best
dancing I've ever done.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:20.419
Yes, it was very nice.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:24.173
But we already have plenty of
gals like you in the troupe.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:27.176
We're looking for
something different today.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:31.806
You know?
More all-American,

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.558
younger and blonde.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.978
Someone with X factor.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:41.774
What?

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:45.611
Next!

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:52.994
Come on.

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:54.996
- Come on.
- No.

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:58.791
I'm afraid so.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.335
Come on, miss.
Time to go.

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:08.342
Please.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:10.595
You don't understand.
I need this.

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:13.806
Next in line, please.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:15.558
I can make it better.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:16.809
Come on now, darling.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:19.562
You don't want to make a scene
and spoil everything.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:22.732
Please! Just give me
one more chance.

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:25.693
- Come on, now.
- No.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.070
I'm a... I'm a star.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.991
Come on. Come
on, miss. I'm sorry.

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.493
- It's time to go.
- No, I'm a star!

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:35.620
Come on.

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:41.876
Please! I'm a star!

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:43.669
I'm sorry. It's time to go.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.005
Please, somebody help me!

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:49.800
Please! Help me!
Help me!

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:52.970
No!

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.051
Pearl?

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:35.763
Pearl?

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:42.186
How about I take you home?

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:13.509
Is that our pig?

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.779
Should I go
and fetch your mother?

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:36.741
No.

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:45.499
How about I get you
something nice to drink?

01:15:48.419 --> 01:15:49.920
Mama was right.

01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:54.133
I'm never getting off this farm.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.761
And where would you want to go?

01:15:58.095 --> 01:15:59.847
- Europe.
- Europe?

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.266
What on earth for?

01:16:02.349 --> 01:16:03.517
It'll be in ruins

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:05.895
and you'll never get Howard
back there, I'll tell you.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:09.732
Oh, come on, now.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:10.900
I know you're disappointed,

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:13.319
but there's no sense
in taking it this hard.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.780
It's just a lousy
old church group.

01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:17.990
Those old dolts,

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:22.411
they don't know the first
thing about quality dancing.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:25.498
You don't understand.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:27.041
What don't 1?

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:28.793
Come on, Pearl.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:30.836
What's really the matter?

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:35.800
I don't feel

01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:38.385
well.

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:43.099
You're not coming down with
something, are you?

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:44.475
No.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:45.810
It's nothing like that.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.269
Oh, thank goodness.

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:48.604
If I snuck out of the house

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:51.524
and ended up bringing home
nothing but the germ,

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:54.443
my mother and father
would just kill me.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.322
I'm worried there
may be something

01:16:58.405 --> 01:17:00.366
real wrong with me, Mitsy.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:03.661
How do you mean?

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:07.164
Seems like there's
something missing in me

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:09.375
that the rest of the world has.

01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:12.419
Have you told Howard?

01:17:14.088 --> 01:17:18.050
I've never spoken about it
out loud to anyone.

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:21.053
So afraid of
what people might think.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.346
Pearl...

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.808
Howard's your husband.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.644
He adores you.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:31.480
You shouldn't be afraid
to tell him how you feel.

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:35.109
I'm scared of what I might say.

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:37.778
Well, practice
on me first, then.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:39.822
Pretend I'm Howard,

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.700
and you just say
whatever's on your mind.

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.702
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:46.871
Go on. Get it all out.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.958
- Really?
- Yes.

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:52.626
Trust me.

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:06.348
Howard...

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.190
Go ahead, Pearl.

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:23.490
I hate you so much
for leaving me here,

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:25.492
sometimes I hope you die.

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:30.956
I'm sorry.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.126
I feel awful admitting that,
but it's the truth.

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:38.380
I was curious

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.008
about other men.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.261
I'm sure you don't
want to hear about

01:18:44.345 --> 01:18:46.055
a stranger satisfying your wife,

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.098
and I swear it was only once.

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:50.351
It was a mistake.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:53.479
It wasn't him that I
wanted. I know that now.

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.189
And I wish things
could just go back

01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:56.690
to the way they were before,

01:18:56.774 --> 01:18:58.692
but I don't see how they could,

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:02.571
not after the things I've done.

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.786
What else have you done, Pearl?

01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:10.663
Oh, Howard.

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:13.249
I realize
how this all must sound.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:16.502
Honestly, there was a time
I was flattered

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:19.546
to have someone as handsome
as you pine over me.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:21.924
You're such a good person.
I know that.

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:26.053
I made sure to always be
mindful with your heart.

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:28.639
I never wanted you
to feel jealous.

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:32.017
It's an awful feeling
like a rot,

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:36.021
the way it just twists
and turns at your insides.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:38.274
I know that aching so well.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.859
I feel it.

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:44.530
Whenever I see others
whose lives come easy

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:48.867
because the truth is,
I'm not really a good person.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.453
Pearl, I think I should just...

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:53.998
The reason I kept my eyes to
the ground around other men

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:55.874
was never to avoid hurting you.

01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:00.129
It's because I understood
how lucky I was

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:02.214
to have your attention.

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:05.968
I may be a poor farm girl,
Howard, but I'm not stupid.

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:09.638
I spotted you the moment
you came to live with us.

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.890
You worked hard
like the other farmhands,

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:13.600
but you were different.

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:15.686
You're from somewhere.

01:20:15.769 --> 01:20:17.271
A nice, comfortable place

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:19.982
that you could return to
whenever you wanted.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:24.486
I'm so desperate to have that.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.490
All my life,
I've wanted off this farm

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:30.576
and you were my ticket out.

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.203
So...

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:36.790
I made sure to never let you
see who I really was.

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:39.251
It worked like a charm, too.

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.754
Then when you finally
brought me back

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.589
to your home
to meet your family,

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.257
it was just as I hoped.

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:49.094
A life straight
out of the pictures.

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:53.098
At least that's what
it felt like to me.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:56.852
And you didn't want it.

01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:01.899
You just wanted
to stay here on our farm,

01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:03.817
and that made me so angry.

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:06.236
How could you?

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.281
I'm certain you knew
I hated it, you must've.

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:11.408
How could you be
so selfish and cruel

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:13.660
after all I've done
to make you happy?

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:21.752
I was even pregnant
with your baby.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:29.718
I never wanted to be a mother.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:33.472
I loathed the feeling of it
growing inside me.

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.307
It felt like sickness.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:41.271
Pulling and sucking on me like
some needy animal in a barn.

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:45.317
How could I be responsible
for another life?

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:47.986
Life terrifies me.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.989
It's harsh, and bleak,
and draining.

01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:55.494
I was so relieved when it died.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:57.417
It was one less weight
keeping me trapped here,

01:21:57.496 --> 01:22:00.207
but then the war came
and you left me, too.

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.377
Why did you leave me, Howard?

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.635
I hate feeling like this.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:14.430
So pathetic.

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:17.099
Do people like you
ever feel this way?

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:18.767
I figure you don't.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:21.019
You seem so perfect
all the time.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:23.564
Lord must've been
generous to you.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:26.150
He never answers
any of my prayers.

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:28.610
I don't know why.
What did I do?

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:30.612
What is wrong with me?

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.990
Please, just tell me
so maybe I can get better.

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:34.450
I don't want to end up
like Mama.

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:36.368
I want to be dancing up
on the screen

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:38.537
like the pretty gals
in the pictures.

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:42.541
I want what they have so badly,

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.126
to be perfect,

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:46.712
to be loved from
as many people as possible

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.631
to make up for all my time
spent suffering.

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:54.219
Sometimes I wake
in the middle of the night

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:57.431
and the fear washes over me,
'cause what if this is it?

01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:01.435
What if this is
right where I belong?

01:23:07.107 --> 01:23:08.317
I'm a failure.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.777
I'm not pretty

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.698
or naturally pleasant,
or friendly.

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:16.783
I'm not smart,

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:19.328
or funny, or confident.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:24.124
I'm exactly what Mama said
I was, weak.

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:27.628
I don't know why.
What did I do?

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:29.421
Why wasn't my family like yours?

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:32.508
I hate what it feels like
to be me and not you.

01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:34.551
I'm so scared that
when you finally come home,

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:35.969
you'll see me and be frightened

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:37.763
like everyone else is.

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:43.101
I know what I've done,

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:44.436
the bad things,

01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:49.525
terrible, awful,
murderous things.

01:23:49.608 --> 01:23:52.194
I regret them now,
but I liked how they felt.

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.154
I wish I didn't, but I did.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:59.076
At first, it was only animals
smaller than myself.

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:00.953
Nothing with feelings.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.621
Nothing that could hurt me back.

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:05.040
It felt good.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.876
Killing's easier than you think,

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:10.504
till recently with Mama

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.130
and the boy
from the picture house.

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:13.340
They were different.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.717
They were more meaningful.

01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:17.594
I hurt them
so they too might know

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:18.780
what it feels like to suffer,

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:20.347
but poor Daddy
didn't deserve that.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:22.641
I wish I hadn't done what I did.

01:24:25.435 --> 01:24:26.812
Mama meant well.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.190
She had a hard life.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:32.109
She only wanted a home
to feel safe in.

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:33.318
I can see that.

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:35.111
I thought I hated her,

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:36.989
but I just want to
feel safe, too.

01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:43.036
Lord...

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:47.207
I made such a mess of things.

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:50.544
I don't know how much more
I can take.

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:53.755
I need to clean this up.

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:57.009
All of it.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:25:00.178
I need to make things right
before you see me again.

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:03.473
Maybe if I can turn this farm

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:05.183
into a home for us
like you wanted,

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.019
things will finally
be different.

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:09.855
I can forgive.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:12.482
I can be who you want me to be

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:14.985
if you'll just stay with me.

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:18.155
Would you do that, please?

01:25:20.907 --> 01:25:22.868
I can't be
all by myself anymore.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.077
It's too hard.

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:30.375
We can love each other.

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:32.210
I'll do that for you

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:35.631
if you really meant all that
"till death do us part."

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.051
It'd be enough,

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:43.889
just you and me
here on this farm.

01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:52.856
All I really want
is to be loved.

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:59.279
I'm having such a hard time
without it lately.

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:38.610
I should probably get going now.

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:41.947
Mother will be wondering where
I am if I'm not home soon.

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:52.457
Are you frightened of me?

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:55.584
No.

01:26:58.672 --> 01:26:59.881
Of course not, Pearl.

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:05.095
Do you think I'm sick?

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.223
No.

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:11.518
Thank you.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.982
I'm happy for you.

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:21.820
What?

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.113
For getting the part

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.324
in the dance troupe.
You deserved it.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:31.246
- I didn't get the part.
- It's okay.

01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:33.692
You don't have to
pretend anymore.

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:35.250
My feelings won't be hurt.

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:38.795
If it wasn't me, I'm glad
it was you, right?

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:44.176
- But, Pearl, I...
- Please...

01:27:45.802 --> 01:27:47.012
Don't lie to me.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:56.646
Well, yes.

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:00.317
Thank you.

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.197
It's going to be real swell,

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:08.283
dancing around the state.

01:28:11.411 --> 01:28:15.040
I hope you can come
see the show sometime.

01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:20.879
You always get
everything you want.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.509
You're younger and more blonde.

01:28:27.761 --> 01:28:30.305
I have to go now.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.645
You're not gonna
say anything, are you?

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:39.523
No.

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:48.406
I really do love Howard.

01:28:51.201 --> 01:28:52.410
I know.

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:55.080
Nobody has to know.

01:28:56.122 --> 01:28:57.457
I can fix things.

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:01.211
It can be our secret, Mitsy.

01:29:52.262 --> 01:29:53.597
Help!

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:56.016
Help me!

01:29:56.933 --> 01:29:59.227
Somebody, please help!

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.229
No!

01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:03.148
No, please.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:05.358
Help! Help!

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:18.955
Help!

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.335
Help me, please!

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.253
Help!

01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:36.431
Please, no! No!

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:38.391
I won't tell anyone!

01:30:38.475 --> 01:30:40.018
Please, I swear!

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:42.020
No!

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:45.649
Please! I'll do anything
you want.

01:30:45.732 --> 01:30:48.860
It's not about
what I want anymore, Mitsy.

01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:49.986
Please.

01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:52.489
It's about making the best
of what I have.

01:30:52.572 --> 01:30:55.408
No! No!

01:30:56.618 --> 01:30:58.244
No!

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:44.577
I love you.

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.831
I love you.

01:34:04.055 --> 01:34:06.266
Bless us, O' Lord,

01:34:06.349 --> 01:34:08.977
and these thy gifts

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.897
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty,

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:16.568
through Christ our Lord.

01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:19.320
Amen.

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:00.695
So long, y'all.

01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:19.964
Pearl?

01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:27.305
Pearl?

01:35:49.535 --> 01:35:50.536
Howard?

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:55.833
I'm so happy you're home.
