Cars, too.

118
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't think we're gonna get
an ambulance here,

119
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,583
but the VA Hospital's just
four blocks away, and...

120
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,208
you're gonna need stitches.

121

Um, uh, we just got into a car accident

129

spitting up water.

130
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,000
You okay?

135
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,416
It's a terrorist attack, for sure.

136
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,625
What?

137
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,750
Terrorists?
Able to shut off all the power...

138
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,250
-to cars?
-Maybe it was the Chinese, right?

139
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,166
They built all this shit
so maybe they just turned it all off.

140
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,666
[man 2] And maybe we're at war.

141
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,500
Maybe they blew up New York and LA,
and we're next.

142
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,750
[inhales sharply]

143

[Doris] The phones aren't working,
the power's out--

155
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,291
What happened?

156
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,541
The car's in the lake.

157
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,500
Always clear out the air.

158
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,458
-Always.
-Good girl.

159
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,833
-Hey, Doris, you good on meds?
-[Doris] I got plenty.

160
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,000
The store's not taking credit cards.

161
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,791
Do you have cash for food?

162
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,625
The cash was in the car. In the lake.

163
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,333
I-- I can see if I can pick something
up on the way home from the university.

164
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,708
I'm in at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.
I just need to get a little sleep.

165
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,916
You're still going to work?

166
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,166
Yeah. They don't have power.
They're gonna need security.

167
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,125
You know, there's no point
in you walking home.

168
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,000
Why don't you spend the night?

169
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:34,791
Thanks, Doris.

how you sleep like that.

178
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,791
I'm not sleeping. Meditating.

179
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,083
[inhaling sharply]

180
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,083
Does it help?

181
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,625
Hmm. Think so.

182
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,541
You know when you wake up in the morning,
everything is good for a minute

183
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,208
before the shittiness hits you?

184
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,750
[inhaling]

185
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,541
I get that minute when I meditate.

186
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:21,125
I tried yoga when my hip started hurting,
but...

187
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,583
it didn't work for me.

188
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,708
Do you, uh...

189
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,416
You have a little something
to help me sleep?

190
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,958
I don't do that anymore.

191
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,708
You know the judge said
that I wasn't allowed.

192
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,083
Well, I guess you really aren't using
if you're awake too.

193
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm gonna head to work.

194
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,541
I'll stop at the pharmacy
and get you something.

195
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,916
[floorboards creaking]

196
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,416
[woman 1] Why don't you get some sleep?

197
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,208
[Noah] I'm not tired.

198
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,125
Look at all the shooting stars.

199
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,708
Those are satellites, Noah.

200
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,083
[people shouting indistinctly]

201
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,875
[indistinct screaming]

202
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,000
[more indistinct screaming]

203
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,125
[indistinct shouting]

204
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,458
[people chattering
and laughing indistinctly]

205
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,000
-Hey, hey, hey, I need more stuff.
-Relax, okay?

206
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:10,666
Downers, benzos, phennies, tooies,
red jackets, people are crazy right now,

207
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,833
amped up. That shit'll be, like, gold.
I'll double the price.

208
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,500
No, fuck, I didn't say that.

209
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,416
Yeah. Yeah, you did say that.

210
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,708
All right. I'll do it. Fucking Gregg's
a man of his word, all right?

211
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,791
Cash in, cash out. Cycle of life.

212
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,833
I'll double the price
on all types of zombie pills. Come on.

213
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,375
-Okay.
-Okay.

214
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,041
Angel?

215
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,458
Where the fuck is everyone?

216
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,583
[keys jangling]

217
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,166
[brakes squealing]

218
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,083
[indistinct chattering]

219
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,708
[woman 4] How'd you get
your cars to run, huh?

220
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,416
How come our cars aren't working?
What the fuck is going on?

221
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,375
[banging on door]

222
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,291
-Hey!
-Easy.

223
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,416
Easy. I'm 68 Whiskey. Corporal Adams.
Out of Fort Huachuca.

224
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,291
What are you doing up here?

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,791
Not active anymore. I mean, I might be.

226
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,458
I don't know. They call in reserves yet?
I just don't know.

227
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,458
She's fine.

228
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,333
That's a lot of pills, Jill.

229
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,500
I can explain.
It's not what it looks like, I promise.

230
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,041
-[woman 5] Pack those up for me, please.
-[Jill] Yes, ma'am.

231
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:00,041
I know you stuck your neck out for me
to get this job, and I am so appreciative,

232
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,250
-and-- and I know I screwed up--
-I don't care.

233
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,000
Was that an EMP yesterday? Are we at war?

234
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,375
People are saying it's been happening
all over. Who would we even attack?

235
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,291
[Jill] Major Murphy?

236
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,500
Hard drives are useless.
Anything with a microchip is fried.

237
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,500
Here's everything I have on hard copy.

238
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,250
-Hey.
-Hey.

239
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,250
[soldier] Any additional personnel?

240
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,541
I'm starting a hub.

241
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,041
We could use you.

242
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,333
What's going on, Murphy?

243
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,583
We were the "get answers" people
over there. They need those people again.

244
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,583
[soldier] Major...

245
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,458
we need to go now.

246
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,208
I can't do that anymore.

247
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,375
This is the location of the hub.

248
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,750
I'd like you to get Lori and my children,
and...

249
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,750
get down there as soon as you can,
all right?

250
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,125
Absolutely. No problem.

251
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,000
[man 3]
You don't understand how serious this is.

252
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,291
You should have gone with her.

253
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,041
How is Murphy gonna bring the power back?
She's a psychiatrist.

254
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,500
[man 3] It's not about the power.

255
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,916
There are contingencies for that.
Replace enough wires and fuses...

256
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,250
It's about the people.

257
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,666
Nobody can sleep.

258
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,166
[exhaling] After 48 hours of no sleep,
there's a loss of critical thinking.

259
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,875
Ninety-six hours,
hallucinations, motor failure.

260
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,500
But what about after that?
Organs will fail but then what?

261
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,708
Days of lying in paralysis
until the heart shuts off?

262
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, yeah, I know what happens.

263
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,041
Of course, you do.

264
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,000
But this is different.

265
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,916
Everything is accelerated.

266
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,791
Symptoms are appearing
two to three times quicker.

267
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,208
It's gonna be total chaos.

268
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,291
We're not all going to die.

269
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,916
-Well, this is not happening to everyone.
-Yes, it is.

270
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,958
Well, there is this one woman
who can sleep.

271
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,708
They're bringing her to this hub.

272
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,166
Matilda was sleeping too.
My daughter was sleeping.

273
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:58,875
Are you sure?

274
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,750
Jill, they're setting up a whole station
based on this one sleeper.

275
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,791
That's how big of a deal she is.

276
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,416
Are you sure your daughter was sleeping?

277
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,708
Oh, I-I... I got into a car accident,

278
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,333
-but I'm fine.
-Was your daughter also hurt?

279
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,833
What are you saying?

280
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,958
I'm just saying,
odds are she wasn't sleeping.

281
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,750
What, do you think she's unconscious?

282
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,791
There are no such thing
as unconscious people anymore.

283
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,291
They're either...

284
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,333
on, or they're...

285
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:33,875
off.

286
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,083
[footsteps hurriedly departing]

287
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,000
[door closing]

288
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
[dogs barking]

289
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,333
Matilda?

290
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,625
Matilda!

291
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:03,875
Matilda!

292
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,500
[panting]

293
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,083
Where is she? Where is she? Where is she?

294
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,833
Where is your sister?
Where is your sister?

295
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,833
You're hurting me!

296
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,416
-[shaky breathing]
-Psycho.

297
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,666
I'm sorry, I know.

298
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,416
Where-- Where is Matilda? Is she okay?

299
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,625
Yeah, she's fine.

300
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,875
Where is she? Please, Noah.

301
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,541
Church. Grandma took her to church.

302
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,833
Maybe we are meant to be awake.

303
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,208
'Cause you need to be woke
to see how the world really is.

304
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,708
And the Lord says,
"Come to me, all who labor

305
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,833
and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest."

306
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,458
She's not sleeping.

307
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,375
[knocking on door]

308
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,583
[door opening]

309
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,000
[footsteps approaching]

310
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,333
[door closing]

311
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,291
Not sleeping, Birdie?

312
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,708
Only my dad called me that.

313
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,166
I'm sorry, I forgot. I'm just... tired.

314
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,458
[pastor sighing]

315
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,375
Not everyone...

316
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,416
asked to be called to God, you know.

317
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,541
Some people just are.

318
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,958
I know that more than most
because before I was a pastor...

319
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,458
I was a drug addict.

320
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:34,916
[chuckling]

321
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,458
Covered up the evidence with a tattoo.

322
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,666
I overdosed.

323
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,250
I mean, I should've died within hours,
but I didn't.

324
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,625
I had built up such an immunity
to narcotics over the years, I just...

325
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,625
laid there for three days in rest...

326
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,541
'til eventually I passed.

327
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,541
But I was only gone for a minute
when they found me.

328
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,500
So, like Jesus, I...
returned from the dead.

329
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,416
[chuckling]

330
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,291
Now, I'm not comparing myself to Jesus.
I just...

331
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,416
[inhales deeply]

332
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,291
I'm saying that...

333
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,291
since that day,
I dedicated my life to serving him.

334
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,041
And to me...

335
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,375
it was a miracle that I survived,
you know?

336
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,541
And I think people really need
a miracle right now.

337
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,458
I'm not sure what...

338
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:42,916
I mean...

339
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,000
You think I need to die?

340
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:49,916
No.

341
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,875
No, of course not.

342
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,750
No, I'm sorry. No.

343
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,041
I, um...

344
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,625
[inhaling deeply]

345
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,208
[pastor exhaling]

346
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,833
It's just everyone is tired
and... desperate, you know?

347
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,250
People just want to know if you can sleep.

348
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,750
I can sleep.

349
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,875
It's just hard when I'm not tired.

350
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,000
Would it be okay if I prayed with you?

351
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,250
A lot of children say my prayers
are so boring, they nod right off.

352
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,166
[chuckling]

353
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:43,041
Lord, we thank you for this day
and we thank you for Matilda.

354
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,000
What the...

355
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:48,916
[panting]

356
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,291
Oh, okay.

357
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:55,375
717-127-0414.

358
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:56,833
[grunting]

359
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,750
[mumbling numbers softly]

360
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,416
[Noah] Pizza, really?

361
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,750
Uh, no, it's a test
for mental sharpness.

362
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,000
-[Noah] How'd you do?
-I-I got two wrong. It's fine.

363
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,625
Uh, we need to go and find a car,
and get your sister somewhere safe, okay?

364
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,208
Everything with a circuit's fried.

365
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,916
-Cars don't work, Jill.
-[sighing] Some do, Noah. Okay?

366
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,916
So, can you just help me out, please?

367
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,541
Grab your bag. Let's go.

368
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,416
We need to be careful.

369
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,916
Oh, shit!

370
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,208
-Your daughter, can she sleep?
-[Jill] What?

371
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,583
-Is this your boyfriend?
-No. No!

372
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,625
[Jill panting]

373
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,500
She can't sleep? Is she okay?

374
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,791
No, she's fine, she's fine. I was wrong.
She was just pretending.

375
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,000
Matilda was totally sleeping.

376
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,083
I woke her up.

377
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,000
[Jill sighing]

378
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,583
What? She was sleeping.

379
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,750
Jesus, Jill, we need to get your daughter
to Murphy.

380
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,833
-Look, she could be key.
-Noah, we gotta go.

381
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,958
I know where the hub is.

382
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,875
They're setting up a station
to help solve this.

383
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,375
Look, they already have this one sleeper.

384
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,458
Brian, we're not going there.
Come on. Noah, let's go.

385
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,375
[Jill yelling] Hey! Yo, that's my bike!

386
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,625
Hey!

387
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,541
[pastor] In our basement,
like an angel of peace,

388
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,000
a young girl sleeps.

389
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,958
So if she can sleep,

390
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,125
-that means we can too.
-[people murmuring]

391
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,250
So, as all mankind lays awake,

392
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,583
we pray for answers.

393
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,000
-[man 4] Pastor...
-Yeah.

394
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,500
So what if she can sleep?

395
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,833
Miracles spread, Jim.

396
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,458
Just like good grows,
if you believe in it,

397
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,875
if you give it a fighting chance.

398
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,375
[man 5] There is no over-the-counter
sleeping pills left.

399
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,166
[man 6] Give us the stuff
behind the counter!

400
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,500
[man 5] You'll have to talk
to your doctors. Get the notes.

401
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,041
[man 6] You know no doctor's answering
his phone.

402
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,416
Please, I can't help you!

403
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,375
[indistinct screaming]

404
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,041
Come on.

405
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,666
Come on, Noah. Keep up.

406
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,416
[indistinct screaming continues]

407
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,625
Come on.

408
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:55,375
Whoa.

409
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,291
[Jill] Wait here.

410
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:17,833
[Noah] Oh, God.

411
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,166
It's only going to get worse.

412
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,458
What's happening to everyone?

413
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,458
[indistinct screaming]

414
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,791
[dog barking]

415
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,333
If we don't sleep...

416
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,791
Your mind will bend and bend
until it breaks.

417
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,500
-[Noah sighing]
-You snap.

418
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,541
Life changes like that.

419
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:40,416
But it's adversity
that prompts us to change

420
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,125
-when we otherwise wouldn't.
-[all] Amen.

421
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,583
So then we embrace it.

422
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,000
[Jim] Pastor...

423
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,875
She's awake.

424
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,583
[people murmuring]

425
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,833
-Matilda...
-When are you gonna make us sleep?

426
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:56,583
-Patience, please.
-[man 7] I don't have patience right now.

427
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:59,666
Raymond isn't responding.
He's eating but not talking.

428
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,583
-He's tired, just like the rest of us.
-He's beyond tired.

429
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,250
-He'll be fine.
-[woman 6] We should sacrifice her.

430
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,375
[pastor] No.

431
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:09,791
God sacrificed Jesus,
his own son, to save us.

432
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,000
God willingly sacrificed himself
for our sins.

433
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,958
There is no sacrifice needed.
We... We only need prayer.

434
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,541
God help me,
I'm willing to be Pontius Pilate

435
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,500
-and condemn the girl.
-Robert, sit down.

436
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,416
[yelling] Sit down!

437
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,250
-[pastor] That's enough.
-[man 7] What good is prayer?

438
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,416
We need sleep.

439
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,833
Oh. Matilda.

440
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,625
-[Matilda] Mommy!
-Hey, hold on.

441
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:31,166
Please, sit-- Sit down everyone.

442
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,291
Jill, we just wanted to pray with Matilda,
that's it.

443
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,958
She can sleep. Maybe she can help.
Lord knows we all need help right now.

444
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:42,083
Come on. Matilda is my daughter,
and she's coming with me.

445
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,541
-[woman 7] Not legally, she ain't.
-Please, sit-- sit down.

446
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:47,750
Doris... Doris takes care
of those kids by law.

447
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:50,791
You're right.

448
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,875
But right now, with what's happening,

449
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,500
I can help, and you know I can help.

450
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,041
-[Jill] Okay, come on, Matilda. Let's go.
-[Jim] She has to stay here.

451
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,041
[pastor] Hey, Jim.

452
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,125
She's special.

453
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,208
-[woman 8] She is.
-Okay.

454
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,875
-Just calm down, everyone.
-[Matilda] Mom?

455
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,750
-[man] Pastor, you promised.
-Sit down, please.

456
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,666
[Brian] We're on the same team here.

457
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,833
You're all absolutely right.

458
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,458
-She is special.
-[woman 9] That's right.

459
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,000
[Brian] But she can't help anyone here.

460
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,583
Now, we're all gonna die

461
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,458
if we don't solve this.

462
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,750
Right now, your brains
are slowly swelling.

463
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,875
Our cranial walls are impressing
on the brain,

464
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,833
and it's affecting critical thinking.

465
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,250
It's what happens when we don't sleep.

466
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:40,291
Now, the more excited we get,

467
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,958
the more blood flows to the brain,
the worse we are.

468
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,208
So, the best thing we can do right now...

469
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,416
[inhaling deeply]

470
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,750
is take a deep breath...

471
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,708
[exhaling]

472
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:51,458
and calm down.

473
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,250
Now, we're gathering scientists
and doctors to help solve this.

474
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,083
And they can.

475
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,208
And all they need is the girl.

476
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:08,666
Mom?

477
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,583
[breathing heavily]

478
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,791
No one dismisses the value of science,

479
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:16,875
but neither is she a test subject
to run experiments on...

480
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:19,125
-You're not taking her anywhere.
-[pastor] Jim, please.

481
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,791
-[woman 10] That's right.
-Prayers are not gonna save--

482
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,375
Fucking people,

483
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,833
if you don't hand her over,
I'll be back with the Army,

484
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,250
and they're not gonna ask nicely.

485
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,125
-You calm down!
-[Brian] Is that what you want?

486
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,916
Because unless you people wake up,
that is exactly what is gonna happen.

487
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,375
And book throwing, that's gonna--

488
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,291
[gunshot]

489
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,291
[people screaming]

490
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,541
[pastor] Jim, what have you done?

491
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,583
[woman 7] Doris took her down the back.

492
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:45,708
Noah, Noah, look at me.
You're gonna be okay. All right?

493
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,541
I need you to meet me in the forest
out back. I'm gonna get your sister.

494
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,500
[people screaming indistinctly]]

495
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,666
-[woman 11] She in there?
-[man 9] Hey!

496
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,500
-[man 9] Bring her out!
-[man 10] Get her out here!

497
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:09,333
[man 9] She's not in there.
Get the guys. Let's look out back.

498
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,916
[crowd murmuring indistinctly]

499
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,541
[crowd gasping]

500
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,458
-[Doris gasping]
-Where is she?

501
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,958
[Doris] She's not in there? She was.

502
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:19,625
It's a miracle.

503
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,000
This isn't Jesus
rising from the tomb, Doris.

504
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,166
This is not who we are.

505
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,041
[pastor] Jim?

506
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:34,958
Jim!

507
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,541
[soft crying]

508
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:42,500
Matilda.

509
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,666
Oh, my God, my baby.

510
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,833
-Oh, baby. Oh, baby.
-[Matilda whimpering]

511
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:52,291
-Grandma told me to run, but I couldn't.
-Oh, that's okay.

512
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,208
-Are you okay?
-Oh. No, I'm fine, baby. I'm fine.

513
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,500
-Please.
-[Jim] God spoke to me, Pastor.

514
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,458
-Put it down.
-[Jim] We can't let her leave.

515
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,291
Jim, put it-- put it down, please.
You're scaring everyone.

516
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,916
[pastor breathing heavily]

517
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,750
[panting]

518
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:20,541
[pastor] Jim!

519
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,291
Please put down the gun.

520
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:37,458
[gunshots]

521
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,333
-[people screaming]
-[Noah breathing shakily]

522
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,458
[panting]

523
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,833
[Jill] Come on, stay close.

524
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,291
-Come on.
-[Matilda] Mom, stop, please!

525
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,375
What about Grandma!

526
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,916
[panting]

527
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,541
[Jill] Baby...

528
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:56,083
Your grandmother can't run, okay?
She has a condition.

529
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:57,666
-All right?
-But Mom, please--

530
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,583
No, no, no, no. She's gonna be fine.

531
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:02,458
-I need you to keep up with me, okay?
-Okay.

532
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,625
How are you feeling?

533
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:04,666
No more running.

534
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,625
-All right, piggy-back time. Come on.
-Okay.

535
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,583
Let's go, Noah.

536
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,375
[Jill panting]

537
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,416
This way.

538
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,333
Come on.

539
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,916
We're here.

540
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,291
[Matilda panting]

541
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,250
[Jill] Come here.

542
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,750
[Jill panting]

543
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,666
[Jill] We're gonna need a car.
You stay here.

544
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,041
I'm gonna go get one.

545
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:34,041
Where are we going? [panting]

546
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:35,916
They call it the hub.

547
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:37,791
We can't go there.

548
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,583
-You don't know what they're capable of.
-But we need to find a cure.

549
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,791
Noah, it's not that simple.

550
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,375
It-- It's right here,
wherever this-- this is.

551
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:49,125
I touched a dead body to get this.
A dead body!

552
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,125
It's not safe there.

553
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,625
What's your plan here, Jill?

554
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,041
We bring Matilda somewhere safe,

555
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,875
we both die, and she lives alone?

556
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,458
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

557
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:04,708
Here.

558
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,541
Light this. Light it.

559
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:11,083
-Burn it. Burn this, and we can't go.
-Noah, stop that.

560
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,291
It doesn't work.

561
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,125
[breathing heavily]

562
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:19,833
Wake up, Mom.

563
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,333
[Noah] This is our only chance.

564
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,041
If we're all gone,
she'll be dead within days.

565
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:30,708
There's another woman there already.
They're gonna find a cure. They will.

566
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,500
[Noah] Please.

567
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:44,750
Okay.

568
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,000
[birds chirping]

569
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:09,208
[rock clattering]

570
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:11,500
Hello?

571
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,125
Hello?

572
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,250
Gregg?

573
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,250
215-124-0519.

574
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,416
[mumbling softly]

575
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,416
Not even close.

576
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,166
Hello?

577
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:43,541
Gregg?

578
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,291
[man 11] We got the pick of the litter.
How about the Beemer instead?

579
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,916
-[man 12] Idiot! It's gotta be an old car.
-[soft thud]

580
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:56,875
What was that?

581
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,166
[whispering] Gregg.

582
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,500
[Gregg breathing heavily]

583
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,125
[gun cocking]

584
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,833
[Gregg breathing heavily]

585
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,458
It's just Gregg.

586
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,916
He's, like, still awake.

587
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,458
He can't even sleep now?

588
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:21,958
Shit.

589
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,875
Sleep.

590
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,833
-Sleep.
-[Gregg whimpering]

591
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,833
Sleep, baby, sleep.

592
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:37,000
[stomping]

593
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:37,958
Okay.

594
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,208
Okay, can we focus?
Get that Camry started?

595
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:43,750
Goddamn!

596
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,416
World's in chaos
and you're wasting time stomping heads.

597
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,458
Why can't we do the Beemer?

598
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,500
[man 12] This is the last time I tell you.

599
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:57,333
We need an old car. No electronics.

600
00:34:57,416 --> 00:35:01,875
It had no battery in it
when whatever the fuck was happening...

601
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,541
[man 11] Now I'll start it.

602
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,458
The Camaro or the Dodge should work
with one of the older batteries.

603
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,958
[wrench cranking]

604
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,541
Get in. Give it a shot.

605

607
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:17,458
[man 12] Ahh...

608
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:18,708
[car door closing]

609
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,583
[man 11] Transmission's in.
Fingers crossed.

610
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:22,625
[man 12] It's fine.

611
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,708
-[man 11] Tell me when you're ready.
-[man 12] Yeah.

612
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,708

-[engine revving]
-Whoo!

614
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,416
[man 11] There it is.
Told you we could boost the battery.

615
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,916
-[man 12] Sweet!
-[man 11] Go get the keys for the Dodge.

616
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,250
And grab the battery we brought up
from the basement!

617
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,875
-[engine revving]
-[man 11] Ha-ha!

618
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:40,291
[man 12] But I get the Camaro.

619
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,375
[man 11] What?

620
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,708
[man 12] I get the Camaro.

621
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:48,416
-I don't want a Polara. I want a Camaro.
-[man 11] Just grab the keys, pendejo.

622
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,333
[man 12] All right!

623
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,125
All right.

624
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,208
[keys clattering]

625
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,833
[man 11] You find it?

626
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:01,125
[man 12] They're in here somewhere.
You find 'em.

627
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,458
I want the Camaro.

628
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,708
Is that right, sheriff?

629
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,750
[man 12] I'm taking that fucking car.

630
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,208
[man 11] You're not.

631
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:12,000
-Yo, you hear that?
-[car accelerating in the distance]

632
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:15,041
-[man 11] You heard that, right?
-[man 12] Yeah.

633
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,958
Someone else got a car running, too.

634
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:17,875
[man 11] Fuck.

635
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:22,375
[groaning]

636
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,875
Man, they were stocked up. Medical shit.

637
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,541
Bet they could sleep with that.

638
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:30,458
Let's go.

639
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,708
[man 11] Grab all the keys.
We'll come back for the Dodge later.

640
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:35,750

[continues breathing heavily]

651
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,083
Here. It's easy.

652
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:13,708
Just one motion.

653
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,166
Who's Emily?

654
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,166
[Noah] My girlfriend.

655
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,333
Ex-girlfriend.

656
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,458
Did you guys ever...

657
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,541
do it?

658
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:27,791
What?

659
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,125
[vehicle approaching]

660
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,250
Shit.

661
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,458
Mom?

662
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,416
Everything okay?

663
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,416
Noah's never had sex.

664
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:45,541
I--

665
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,125
I have.

666
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:49,791
Hey, get in.

667
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,208
Seat belt on.

668
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:54,666
[car engine purring]

669
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:06,166
So, what happened with this girlfriend?

670
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,208
No.

671
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,916
We're-- We're not going to talk about this
right now.

672
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:14,416
Noah, come on. I basically--
I basically had you when I was your age.

673
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,750
We do not need to have this conversation.

674
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:17,791
Okay.

675
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,875
-But you can talk to me if you--
-[Noah] Are we done?

676
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,625
Yeah, we're done.

677

[Noah sighing]

678
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,708
[Noah] Why her?

679
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,500
Why not us?

680
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,125
[Jill] What's this?

681
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,166
Stay in the car.

682
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:43,875

693
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,916
Those were Murphy's guys
that shot up that car.

694
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,750
I worked with Murphy, overseas.

695
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,791
She helped me get a job
at the university and...

696
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,000
helped me with rehab, too.

697
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:56,083
She's a psychiatrist, Noah.

698
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,458
Sleep expert.

699
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:00,958
In the desert, she would...

700
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:04,291
help set parameters for interrogation.

701
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,416
Sleep deprivation, it was torture.

702
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,875
They killed people.

703
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:26,958
The kind of things that we would do
to try to find answers, it's not human.

704
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,833
Are we still going to the hub?

705
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,250
[sighing]

706
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,208
Yeah.

707
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,333
[Jill] Oh, my God.

708
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:41,916
[tires squealing]

709
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:44,750
[tires squealing]

710
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,375
We're gonna need, like,
a book on mapping.

711
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:52,833
[sighing]

712
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,416
Hey, sweetheart.

713
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,500
[Matilda] Hey.

714
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:08,875
[Jill] You okay?

715
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:10,291
[Matilda] Mm-hmm.

716
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,166
[Jill] Come here.

717
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:15,916
I-- I want to make sure
that you understand how this works, okay?

718
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19,791
Mom, I know how a library works.

719
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:23,166
Yeah. The computers don't work anymore,
so...

720
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,625
This is gonna be your new school.

721
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:28,916
So, when mommy's gone,
you'll need to find a library.

722
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,041
Okay? And... read. Don't stop reading,
and I...

723
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,166
[breathes heavily]

724
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,625
...and I need you to learn
as much as you can, okay?

725
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,291
'Cause you are my smart girl.

726
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,083
All right.

727
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:41,833
All right. Um...

728
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,541
Um, come with me over here.

729
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:45,791
Here we go.

730
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:50,166
Okay, look at me. I'm gonna teach you
something very important, okay?

731
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,833
I need you to learn
how to shoot this gun, okay?

732
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:56,750
And, look at me, not just for people,
but for animals too. All right?

733
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,291
And we're gonna find you a rifle,

734
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:00,125
and you're gonna learn
how to shoot that too,

735
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,625
because the world
is different now, baby, okay?

736
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,666
And you gotta be prepared for anything.

737
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,416
All right? Here we go.

738
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,750
Put two hands on the gun for me.
There you go.

739
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,041
Okay.

740
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,708
Hold onto it strong
just like the handlebars of your bike.

741
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:17,708
Put this foot forward. There we go.
Nice strong stance, okay?

742
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,666
Keep both eyes open.
And you see that eye groove?

743
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,166
I want you to look right through that,
all right?

744
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,500
Now focus, breathe.

745
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:25,583
[shaky breathing]

746
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:26,666
You can do this.

747
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:29,916
I don't like guns.

748
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,583
-Matilda, please.
-[Matilda] I don't want to.

749
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:33,833
-You have to.
-No!

750
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:34,791
-You have to.
-No!

751
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,833
-Yes, Matilda!
-We're gonna find a cure, okay?

752
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:38,666
And you and Noah are gonna shoot the gun.

753
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,541
[Matilda gasping]

754
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,250
[gunshots]

755
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:43,250
[crying]

756
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,416
[Jill] Now you do it.

757
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,083
-Oh.
-[crying] I'm going to the car.

758
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:48,416
Wait, baby. Baby, come--

759
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:49,916
[Noah] Hey!

760
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,125
Did you shoot at me?

761
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,375
No. Noah, I thought you were in the car.

762
00:44:57,916 --> 00:44:59,916
I was here. I said I was here.

763
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:01,875
Who's in the car, Noah?

764
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:02,958
No one.

765
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,916
You said to find books on mapping.

766
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,291
[sighing]

767
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,250
Just don't shoot at me again, okay?

768
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:17,583
[Noah] I think the coordinates lead here.

769
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,041
[Jill] Mmm.

770
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,375
It looks like...

771
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,041
it... it's 1,500 miles away?

772
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:33,166
I think it's 150 miles. I don't know.
We haven't slept in four days.

773
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,291
I-I wrote down the directions.

774
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:27,041
I think.

775
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,458
[thudding in the distance]

776
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:30,791
[thudding continuing]

777
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,416
[man 13] Hey!

778
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:38,000
[Jill panting]

779
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:40,416
Matilda. Come on.

780
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,583
[panting]

781
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,875
[tires squealing]

782
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,666
No. No.

783
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:49,083
[yelling] Stop! Stop!

784
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,208
[man 14] Hey.

785
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,875
I'm not stopping. I'm gonna hit you.
I'm not stopping.

786
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:57,000
[tires squealing]

787
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:58,125
[yelling] Fuck you!

788
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,416
Hey, I ain't gonna hurt you.

789
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,500
I ain't.

790
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:09,583
I promise.

791
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:13,000
Just, hey, let me have the boy.

792
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,958
No, you can go. I'll let you go.
Hey, give me the boy.

793
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,541
I'll let you-- I'll let you go.

794
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,208
I'm just messing around.
I'm messing around.

795
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,708
We're all free men here. It's all good.

796
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:32,791
Hey, can I-- Can I have that gun?

797
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,208
Noah, I'm gonna shoot at one.

798
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:37,125
They're gonna scatter. You're gonna
go inside and lock yourself in, okay?

799
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,541
Noah!

800
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:41,875
-Noah!
-Hey, give me-- Give me the gun.

801
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:44,083
Are you gonna shoot me?

802
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:46,875
Go on.

803
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:48,333
-Sweetheart--
-[gunshot]

804
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:49,708
[men exclaiming]

805
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,166
Noah, run.

806
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,416
[yelling] Noah, run!

807
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,250
Yeah, run, Noah, you pretty little bitch.

808
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:05,291
[tires squealing]

809
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:07,166
Hey, Mommy. Get in.

810
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,458
-Get in, Mom, please.
-Get in!

811
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:11,708
Yeah, get in.

812
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:15,291
-Who are you?
-[man 15] Why does it matter?

813
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,583
What is your name?

814
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,041
-I said, "What's your name?"
-Dodge! Dodge, call me Dodge.

815
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,208
How did you get out, Dodge?

816
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,583
I was locked in the cells,
guards were gone, okay?

817
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:30,500
We were starving, and I thought
that, you know, I was gonna die in there.

818
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,541
And then the guards came back
and opened the cell.

819
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,875
-[Jill] You just walked out?
-Yeah, I just walked out.

820
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:37,291
-Where are you heading?
-I'm in a red fucking jumpsuit. Okay?

821
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,958
I'm heading far away.

822
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,833
-Far from here, okay?
-Watch out!

823
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:42,583
-[Jill, Dodge grunting]
-[tires squealing]

824
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:44,375
[Dodge grunting]

825
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:46,833
[Dodge grunting]

826
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,208
Ha!

827
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,583
[pants, chuckling]

828
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:50,875
[Dodge laughing]

829
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,625
-[Dodge continues laughing]
-[engine idling]

830
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:54,333
There are no bullets in that.

831
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,250
What?

832
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,750
There are no bullets in that gun.

833
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:00,833
[engine turns off]

834
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:03,000
I keep the keys. And we need gas.

835
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:04,500
[door opening]

836
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:08,583
No bullets, huh?

837
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:12,791
Fuck!

838
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,500
Oh, my God.

839
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,125
[Matilda] Mom?

840
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,041
[Jill] Okay, that should be clean enough.

841
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,708
So, you saw I put it in the gas tank,
right?

842
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:33,125
And now I want you to just, um, suck on it
like a straw,

843
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,375
but do it hard,

844
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:37,416
and then when it comes out,
put the gas in the tank.

845
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,458
You're gonna put it in here, okay?

846
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:45,958
So your sister can sleep, huh?

847
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,916
Where's your father at?

848
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,166
[Noah sighing]

849
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,083
He died...

850
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,708
in the war.

851
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:58,708
Oh, he served.

852
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:01,291
Not bad.

853
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,708
Not good either.

854
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,666
[Dodge] Change of clothes, baby!

855
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,375
Go on.

856
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,125
Come on, you can do it.

857
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:32,208
Come on, you gotta learn, Matilda.
You got this.

858
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,833
[sucking]

859
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,958
-[Jill] Oh! Oh.
-[coughing]

860
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,458
-I drank it.
-Okay, baby. It's okay. It's all right.

861
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:42,833
-Spit it out.
-[coughing]

862
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,083
Hey, your mom's hardcore, man.

863
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,833
[sighing] She's getting Matilda ready
in case we can't find a cure.

864
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:52,416
-She thinks I don't know what she's doing.
-A cure?

865
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:56,208
You guys are trying to find a cure?

866
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,041
You know, the funny thing is,
I usually sleep, like,

867
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,791
two to three hours tops at night,

868
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,625
but now, you know...

869
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:14,958
So, you're taking our car?

870
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:20,541
Well, depends where you're heading.

871
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,666
North. Lewisburg, right?

872
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,666
[Dodge] Hmm.

873
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:30,125
That's where I'm heading, too.

874
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:31,791
North.

875
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:36,833
You know, you should probably
hang onto it.

876
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:39,291
You, uh, look pretty mean
pointing it at people.

877
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,791
Just in case something happens.
[chuckling]

00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:53,291
[engine revving repeatedly]

879
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,541
[Jill] That's good, baby.

880
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,916
Remember, two hands on the steering wheel.

881
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,375
Yes, I have two hands.

882
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:03,916
Okay, I was just telling you
so you don't forget.

883
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,250
You always say
I have a really good memory.

884
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,583
-Why do you think I'll forget?
-Eyes on the road, please.

885
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,375
Thank you.
[sighing]

886
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:15,291
Fixing this car is gonna be so hard.
Oh, man. Okay.

887
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:18,375
But there are books on that, okay?
You hear?

888
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:20,958
Burn the books, man. Burn 'em all.

889
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:23,250
-Don't need those anymore.
-Ah, eyes!

890
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,791
Can you maybe just not--
Focus on the road, please.

891
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:28,833
Not talk to her
so she can concentrate, please.

892
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:35,375
[Dodge] Enough people said
that the Earth was flat,

893
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:36,708
so the Earth was flat.

894
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:39,958
Then, they said the Earth was round...

895
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,125
so the Earth was round.

896
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:45,833
The Earth is round.

897
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,125
Prove it.

898
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,750
[Noah] Science proves it.

899
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:54,125
[Dodge laughing] Science?
And who understands the science, huh?

900
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:56,000
Eyes on the road, please, always.

901
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,000
[Dodge] Enough people talk
about something, right?

902
00:52:58,083 --> 00:52:59,208
Then it becomes fact.

903
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:03,750
Then they put it in the books,
and then the book becomes fact.

904
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:04,916
Then it's settled.

905
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:09,166
Then no one understands it anymore,
no one even talks about it anymore.

906
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,125
Fuck, this is why
we gotta burn the books, man.

907
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:13,666
He said the F-word.

908
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,666
I know. Please shut up.

909
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,875
[Dodge, softly] Sorry.

910
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,541
-She's a kid.
-Okay.

911
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:24,583
You know, my grandmama,
you know what she used to tell me?

912
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:26,458
-Huh?
-That all the world's problems

913
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,541
could all disappear in one generation

914
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:32,541
if every kid grew up
forgetting all the shit they were taught,

915
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:35,166
the shit that doesn't make sense,

916
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,708
but you're taught it enough times,
you believe it.

917
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:39,708
Then we can actually live in a world

918
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,666
where no one is starving...

919
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:44,875
and everyone's equal.

920
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,375
-Really?
-Whoa.

921
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:48,000
[tires squealing]

922
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,416
I'm sorry, guys.

923
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,500
I used to think she was crazy, though,
Grandma.

924
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,416
[Dodge laughing]

925
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,083
Man, but now...

926
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,458
maybe she was on to something.

927
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:12,166
-Watch out. You see that there?
-[Matilda] Yeah.

928
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,375
Go right around the car, just like that.

929
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:15,708
Hey...

930
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,750
Slow down. Slow down, put the brake on.

931
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:20,791
[brakes squealing]

932
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,041
What the fuck?

933
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:32,708
Let's go.

934
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:35,500
Let's go, let's go, let's go, right now!
Put your head down, Matilda!

935
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:37,416

you don't want me to stick around

972
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:22,083
and maybe help
with whatever y'all are doing?

973
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,375
No, you go to where you need to get.

We're just gonna, um...

Make sure it's safe.

If I don't come back,
I want you to stay in this house, okay?

987
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,625
There's enough food

[people chattering]

1055
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:08,500
[man 18] Hey, hey.

1056
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:09,625
-[Jill] Huh?
-You.

1057
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:12,958
That's mine.

1058
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,333
Huh? Oh, okay.

1059
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,708
Okay, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1060
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,333
Oh, wh--

1061
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,333
Where's the woman, uh, that can sleep?

1062
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:26,500
Yeah.

1063
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,125
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1064
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,291
You need blood samples?

1065
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:50,458
They already did radio x-ray.

1066
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,875
Yeah, I need blood--
I need to take blood samples.

1067
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:56,791
Yeah. Okay.

1068
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:00,041
Okay.

1069
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,791
[woman 14 breathing heavily]

1070
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:38,375
[woman 14 groaning] Oh.

1071
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:41,083
How much blood can you take from me?

1072
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,583
[breathing heavily]

1073
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:44,375
It's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.

1074
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:46,791
I want out of here.

1075
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:48,208
[groaning]

1076
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:51,291
Good. I can help you with that.

1077
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:01,875
You need to raise my daughter.

1078
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:05,166
I have a little girl. She's ten years old,

1079
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,250
and she needs you to help her
in the new world.

1080
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:09,166
[clears throat]

1081
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:10,583
I...

1082
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,166
I can't--

1083
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:14,333
I...

1084
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:15,458
-I can't--
-No.

1085
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:16,875
Is-- Why?

1086
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:18,416
She can't make it on her own.

1087
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,750
She needs somebody to help her.

1088
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:23,666
Okay? She needs someone to help her.
You're the only one who can do it.

1089
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:27,416
In the next few days,
the rest of us are gonna be dead, okay?

1090
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,083
I'm gonna take you out of here.

1091
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:31,458
I'm the one that needs help.

1092
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:34,916
[inhales deeply] I was supposed to be dead
months ago.

1093
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:37,875
You're crazier than the rest of them.

1094
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:39,833
Jill?

1095
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:42,958
[Jill] Dr. Murphy.

1096
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:44,958
I, uh...

1097
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:46,958
-[Murphy] What are you doing here?
-[panting]

1098
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:48,916
I came to help.

1099
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,375
After you left the campus,
Brian helped me with the coordinates.

1100
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:54,291
Brian...

1101
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:57,041
My family, are-- are they with you?

1102
01:04:57,416 --> 01:04:58,375
Oh...

1103
01:04:59,916 --> 01:05:01,458
No, uh...

1104
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,166
Brian was, um...

1105
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:07,333
I'm-- I didn't see him again.
So I'm assuming he was here.

1106
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,333
They're not here?

1107
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,875
I'm sorry.

1108
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:16,000
Uh...

1109
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,083
Is there a cure?

1110
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,625
It's been six days, and we're no closer.

1111
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:26,166
We have, um, a cocktail
that helps with mental acuity,

1112
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,916
but it's-- it's causing some...

1113
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:29,958
neurological damage.

1114
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,000
But it is...

1115
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,458
It's buying us some time.

1116
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,708
This morning, I...

1117
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:37,541
[inhaling deeply] I thought...

1118
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,083
maybe the only answer...

1119
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:41,416
[chuckling]

1120
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,916
we're gonna get is...

1121
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,041
that none of us are gonna survive.

1122
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:49,291
But...

1123
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,625
you got here, right?
[chuckling]

1124
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:53,375
I mean, that must mean something.

1125
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:56,333
Get some meds...

1126
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:59,583
get situated, and let's get to work.

1127
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,208
I'm so glad you're here.

1128
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:05,750
[breathing heavily]

1129
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:10,166
Oh.

1130
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:13,208
Uh...

1131
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:19,458
Oh.

1132
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,583
[thunder crashing]

1133
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,375

[rain pattering]

1137
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,625
[thunder crashing]

1138
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:01,500
[men yelling indistinctly in the distance]

1139
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,375
[loud banging]

[tires squealing]

1142
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:14,333
[soldiers yelling indistinctly]

1143
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:16,291
-[tires squealing]
-Hands up! Get out!

1144
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,333
-Get down! On your knees!
-Get out of the car.

1145
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:19,375
-[soldier] Hands up!
-No.

1146
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:21,833
-[Dodge] Don't shoot, okay?
-[soldier] Get down on your knees!

1147
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:22,833
Don't shoot!

1148
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,625
-Listen!
-[soldier] Get out of the car!

1149
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,000
-No, no!
-[soldier] On your knees!

1150
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:29,041
-Okay, okay, I'm here to help!
-Get out of the car.

1151
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:31,833
-[Dodge] I'm here to help.
-Show me your fucking hands!

1152
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:33,833
-Oh, no.
-[Dodge] Listen.

1153
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,166
No, no!

1154
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,416
[soldier 4] Hands up! Hands!

1155
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,958
[Jill] Hey! Oh! [gasping, grunting]
-[soldier grunting]

1156
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,000
[Jill] Oh, God!

1157
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,166
Don't fucking move!

1158
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,958
[soldier 1] On your fucking knees!

1159
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:47,500
-[soldier 2] I'll blow your head off!
-[cries out]

1160
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,291
I will shoot you in the fucking face!

1161
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:52,666
-[soldier 3] Get out of the car. Hands up!
-[Dodge] Okay, don't shoot!

1162
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:53,916

1163
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,250
-[Dodge] We're here to help. Okay?
-Keep moving! Show me your hands! Go!

1164
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,000
-[soldier 1] Keep moving!
-[Dodge] She's just a little girl!

1165
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,166
Stop moving!

1166
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:06,291
[Matilda crying]

1167
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,375
[thunder crashing]

1168
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:12,666
I can sleep.

1169
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,083
[crying]

1170
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:16,250
I can sleep.

1171
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:18,208
[sighing]

1172
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,250
[sighing]

1173
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,958
I can help people sleep?

1174
01:08:30,666 --> 01:08:31,583
[Katz] Yes.

1175
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:35,500
And we need to find out
what makes you so special.

1176
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,000
Is he still alive?

1177
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:49,041
[Katz] Oh, yeah, she is still alive.

1178
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:54,500
We, um...

1179
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,583
had to ease the tension by...

1180
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:01,833
draining the cerebral fluid, but...

1181
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:04,125
that hasn't helped.

1182
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:07,791
A catch-22. The only way
to ease the tension is to drain the fluid,

1183
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:11,375
the only way to clean the brain
is the fluid.

1184
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:14,541
Can I touch her?

1185
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:16,000
[Katz] Sure.

1186
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,541
You're such a brave, sweet girl.

1187
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:23,541
[chimp whimpering]

1188
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:31,000
[whimpering]

1189
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,875
[Katz] Ether.

1190
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:43,833
Well, see?

1191
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:46,208
Nothing.

1192
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:48,208
-[chimp whimpering]
-No effect.

1193
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,916
Most animals are able to sleep...

1194
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,833
after the incident, but chimps, well...

1195
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:58,916
they were always closest to humans.

1196
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,625
[Murphy] Hi.

1197
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:04,708
I'm Dr. Murphy,
I'm-- I'm a friend of your mom's.

1198
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,208
Can she?

1199
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:11,125
[Katz] Uh, we're gonna, um...

1200
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,875
try the ether on you now, Matilda.

1201
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:17,166
-To prove that you're special.
-[Matilda] Will it hurt?

1202
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,833
[Katz] No, we're not gonna hurt you.
I'm a doctor.

1203
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:21,666
We don't hurt people.

1204
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,375
[Murphy] Kinda weird, huh?

1205
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:24,333
Yeah.

1206
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,666
[Murphy] Slow, easy breaths, babe.

1207
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,583
There you go.

1208
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:35,750
Nice and easy. It's okay.

1209
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,291
Nice and easy.

1210
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:54,083
She sleeps.

1211
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:57,666
Poor thing.

1212
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:04,208
Amazing.

1213
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:18,458
[Murphy sighing]

1214
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:19,875
Hey.

1215
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:23,250
I...

1216
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,416
I want to be disappointed...

1217
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:29,375
that you didn't tell me about Matilda

1218
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
after all I've done for you.

1219
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:34,250
But, as a mother, I understand.

1220
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,833
[sighing]

1221
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:40,250
How long have I been here?

1222
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:41,708
Uh...

1223
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,333
Eighteen hours.

1224
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:49,250
Why can she sleep?

1225
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,125
Who?

1226
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:52,958
[Murphy] Who? Matilda.

1227
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:00,000
Has she had any, um... any surgeries?

1228
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,458
How long have I been here?

1229
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:11,791
It was, um...

1230
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:13,833
some sort of a...

1231
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,916
a solar flare, we think.

1232
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:19,375
It... changed our electromagnetic wiring.

1233
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:21,708
It affected our glymphatic system.

1234
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:24,166
Messed with our...

1235
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:25,666
our clocks.

1236
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,291
Matilda.

1237
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,208
Matilda.

1238
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,583
Oh, please, let her go.

1239
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:33,500
Jill, your survival--

1240
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:36,875
Our-- Our survival depends on Matilda.

1241
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:37,833
Hmm?

1242
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:39,208
Gotta keep trying.

1243
01:12:39,291 --> 01:12:40,625
[Jill] Oh, no, please.

1244
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:44,333
Oh, no, please, please.
No, no, no, that's my baby.

1245
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:45,625
That's my baby.

1246
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:49,833
That's my baby girl. Please just take,
like, blood samples or something, please!

1247
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,125
[door opening]

1248
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:58,583
You really an electr-- electrician?

1249
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:02,958
[woman 13] Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

1250
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:07,833
It's a cocktail of anti-inflammatories,
stimulants, other things.

1251
01:13:08,666 --> 01:13:10,166
It reduces the beta-amyloid.

1252
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:12,083
It'll help.

1253
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:18,666
Um, it's most effective
when injected near the brain.

1254
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:20,791
The carotid.

1255
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,166
Fuck that.

1256
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:24,833
Fuck--

1257
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:25,791
What--

1258
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,125
Okay.

1261
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:49,625
[Katz] Ah.

1262
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:52,541
-[Katz grunting]
-I think she stopped breathing.

1263
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:53,666
[Katz] Huh?

1264
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:58,541
Defib. Hey! I need your help! Okay.

1265
01:13:59,000 --> 01:13:59,958
Okay, come on.

1266
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:03,166
-I need you to press "charge."
-[Murphy] Okay.

1267
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,250
-[Katz] Okay? Charge.
-[Murphy] Ready. Charging.

1268
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:06,166
[Katz] Clear!

1269
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,083
You're hurting her.

1270
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:09,458
[Katz] We're trying to restart her heart.
Do it again.

1271
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:10,833
-[Murphy] Charging.
-[Katz] Clear!

1272
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,958

-[Katz] One more time.

1273

-[Matilda gasping]
-[Murphy] Charging.

1274
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,333
[Katz] Clear!

1275
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:29,916
[nurse] It's all the spiders in here.

1276
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:31,500
There's too many.

1277
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:34,625
That's why they're all melting.

1278
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,958
We have to get rid of the spiders.

1279
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:39,375
-It's all the spiders in here.
-[Murphy] Well...

1280
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:42,208
Let's get her brother up here...
so we can compare them.

1281
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:43,958
-[nurse] There's too many.
-What?

1282
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,208
I have to save...

1283
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:50,125
[gasping] We need to save her.

1284
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:53,583
We... We need...

1285
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:55,583
-You lied to me.
-We-- We just--

1286
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:57,958
[Noah] You wanted to find a stranger
to leave Matilda with.

1287
01:14:58,041 --> 01:14:59,416
I guess that's what you do.

1288
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:02,166
You rely on other people
to raise your kids.

1289
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,833
[screaming] No!
[gasping]

1290
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,583
-Why didn't you just tell me?
-Noah!

1291
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:08,541
Why did you bring me here? Why'd you
make me think it was just for me? Why?

1292
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:11,041
-I'm sorry. [gasping]
-[Noah] That doesn't mean anything.

1293
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:13,250

1294

They're losing their minds.

01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:05,958
She's okay? You're okay.

1314
