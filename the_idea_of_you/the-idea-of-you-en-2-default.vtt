00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,125

I'll get it.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,083
Okay, Mom.

25
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,041
Hi.
- Hello.

26
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,333
Lea dropped it off this morning.

27
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,000
She is so happy it's yours.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,833
I know exactly
where I'm gonna put it.

29
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,541
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
- Thank you!

30
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,916
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

31
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:54,250
So Daniel got her this, like, all-access
backstage pass and a VIP meet and greet

32
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,291
with that boy band she used to like,
August Moon.

33
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,958
Oh, yeah, they're cute.

34
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,041
Mm-hmm.
- That sounds fun, Izz.

35
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,875
You get to meet August Moon?

36
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,250
I'm not really into them anymore.

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,291
Now it's more about, like, aggressively
talented female singer-songwriters.

38
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,125
Which I think is great.
- Right, of course, of course.

39
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,333
Oh, they're here.

40
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,500
Hi.

41
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,875
Hey. -What's up?
- Hi.

42
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,250
Oh, my God, you guys took forever.
Hey.

43
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,125
VIP meet and greet,
all-access backstage pass,

44
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,750
her friends are coming,

45
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,083
and, oh, yeah, Eva's going, too.
- Ugh.

46
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,333
Hi.
- Hi.

47
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,833
Hi. You look so cute.
- Hi. -Thank you.

48
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,333
So you're going camping alone?
- Yes.

49
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,500
And why would you do that?
- Seriously? Why wouldn't I do that?

50
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,041
Bears? Serial killers?

51
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,166
Dirt?

52
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,041
I'm looking forward to it.

53
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,833
Have a little me time,
process the last 20 years.

54
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:49,083
And what if I could just be the sort of
person that goes camping by herself?

55
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,625
What if all I need is Izz

56
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:55,333
and my artists and my gallery
and my friends?

57
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,500
Okay. Well, is that what you want?
- Maybe that's all I want.

58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,416
But is it?

59
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,083
I'm going camping to find out, right?

60
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,666
Speaking of things you want,
your 40th birthday party.

61
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,041
I don't need a party.

62
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,458
Thank you. I love you. Don't need it.

63
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,916

64
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,958

you fucking destroyed my life.

I'm in airplane mode. What's going on?
Hi.

144
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,791
What's happening? What's...
- I can't do the trip now.

145
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,750
Daniel...
- My whole merger thing just blew up.

146
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,833
I... S-Sol, can you please
take them to Coachella?

147
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,875
Everything's paid for, all the hotels,
the meals.
- What?

148
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,125
It's all set.
- Are you kidding me?

149
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,833
They're booking tickets to Houston.
I-- It's happening right now.

00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,958
Really fast, really fast.
- Okay, sorry, sorry.

172
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,000
Look after one another.
And please check your texts.
- Yes.

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,375
We're good. We're good.
- Come on, come on. Let's go!

174
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,708
Okay. Bye.
- Come on. Bye.
- Bye, Solène!

175
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,625
Love you.
Whoo!
- Don't be stupid stupid!

176
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,541
We won't!

177
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,958
Okay.

Sorry?
- Getting Mooned.

188
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,041
What?

189
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,541
Once a Moonhead, always a Moonhead.

190
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,875
I'm here with my daughter and...

191
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,416
So which one is your favorite?

192
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,583
Oh, sorry.

193
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,583
Which one is your "daughter's" favorite?

194
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,250
No, I...

195
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,375
Mine's Adrian.

196
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,166
I mean, just look at him.

197
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,708
He's such a hottie.

198
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,791
Uh, actually, do you know
where the bathroom is?

199
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,458
Uh, yeah. Right out there.

200
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,458
The VIP ones are on the right.
- On the right?

201
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,000
Mm-hmm.
- Okay, great. Thank you.

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,833
Have a good one.
- See ya.

203
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,166
Oh, uh, just a second.

204
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,541
Okay.

205
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,041
Hi.
- Hi.

206
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,541
Do you mind?

207
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh, you... you want to use the bathroom.

208
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,958
Yeah. Um, thanks.

209
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,125
Yeah.

210
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,458
Okay.

211
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,375
Hi again.

212
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,541
Are you a part of that ASMR community
that gets off on listening to people pee?

213
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,833
No, I wasn't...

214
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,125
Because I don't think
you can just go around assuming...

215
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,666
It's actually my trailer.
- What?

216
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,625
It's not literally mine.
You know, I don't own it.

217
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,583
This is your trailer?
- Yeah.

218
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,375
I'm in a band. We're performing
on the main stage in an hour.

219
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,833
I'm Hayes Campbell.

220
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,541
August Moon?

221
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,833
Yeah.

222
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,125
I absolutely know who you are.

223
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,916
Um, anyway...

224
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,250
I'll...

225
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,500
Hey, you know, if you wanted to, um...

226
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,875
...I don't know, hang out.

227
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,208
Hang out?
- Yeah.

228
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,125
Do you want a drink?

229
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,875
Uh...
- I mean, I've got
all the, uh, the-the sodas,

230
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,250
the healthy ones, the not-so-healthy ones.

231
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,416
Um... there's kombucha.

232
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:20,333
Which, in case you never tried it,
it's like kind of a... a salad dressing.

233
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,333
Uh, but we also have beer,
we have wine, um, um, vodka...

234
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,500
Um, I'm actually with
my daughter for the...

235
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,625
August Moon meet and greet, and,
uh, I'm driving, so I don't think it's...

236
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,291
Your daughter,
she's, um, an August Moon fan?

237
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,583
Sh-She was.

238
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,458
Ouch.
- Very sorry.

239
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:44,333
I-I do think she will be, um...
a future nostalgic fan,

240
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,125
but at this moment, today, right now,

241
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:51,041
you are so "seventh grade."

242
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,333
Damn.

243
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,458
Truth hurts, doesn't it?

244
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,625
My, uh, daughter's father bought
the tickets for the meet and greet,

245
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,750
and, um, he was
supposed to be here with her.

246
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,958
He...

247
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,125
Anyway, uh, canceled last minute.
Now I'm here...

248
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,875
So her father, not your husband?

249
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:11,166
Well, he was my husband,
but now he's just her father.

250
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,333
Mm.

251
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,791
Hayes, I think
they're almost ready for you.

252
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,875
Who are you?

253
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,375
It's okay, Desmond.

254
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,666
She's, uh, a friend.
Knock, knock, Hayes.

255
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,458
It's showtime.
- Okay.

256
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,125
Um, okay, so do you need me to dress you?
- Ha.

257
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,250
No. I'm fine, Jodie.

258
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,875
Okay. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,250
All right.
- Thanks, Jodie.

260
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,541
Yeah, mm-hmm.

261
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,708
That was Jodie.

262
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,583
Jodie.
- Yeah.

263
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,708
Do you need someone to help dress you?

264
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,625
On special occasions, yeah, sometimes.
- Mm.

265
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,791
Ah.

266
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,791
I'm gonna...
- Oh, excuse me.

267
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,958
I'll just...

268
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,708
We've got news.

269
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,500
We got the TAG Heuer campaign.

270
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,083
Oh.
- And he wants you to wear a watch.

271
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,250
Great.
- So let's take this off.

272
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,375
Let's get a look at this. And you need...
- Okay, yeah.

273
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,416
These off? Okay.
- Yes, let's take those off.

274
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,208
Uh, James?

275
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,750
This is gonna be the best option.

276
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,875

But, hey, but you don't understand.

295
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,458
St. Vincent was killing it.
We couldn't leave.

296
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,125
No, it truly was transcendent.
- Okay, great. Let's just do...

00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,375
Oh, can we go back, really quick?
- We got to do this first, baby.

00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,750
Okay, I... [sighs] Wh-Why?

299
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,333
Because your dad paid
a lot of money for this.

300
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,541
I'm-I'm so grateful for that,
but August Moon is just, like, so...

301
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,375
Seventh grade.

302
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,166
N... No.

303
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,666
Sorry, I-- Thank you.

304
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,875
I...

305
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,250
Epic. Yeah.

306
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,875
She was gonna say,
"August Moon is so epic."
-"Epic"? Okay.

307
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,166
Yeah. Hey there.

308
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,375
I'm Zeke Randall,
Campbell Hall High School class treasurer.

309
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,000
It's truly an honor to meet you.

310
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,375
It's a pleasure to meet you.

311
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,958
Hey.
- Hi.

312
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,083
I love your shirt. There you go.
- Thank you.

313
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,708
Could you just, like, yeah,
could you just sign that for me?

314
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,291
Yeah, thanks.

315
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,083
Can I take a picture?
- Yes, please.

316
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,583
Hey.

317
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,791
Hi.
- I'm-- uh, it-it's for,
uh, it's for Izz-- it's for Izzy.

318
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,125
Izzy. All right.
- Yeah.

319
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,625
Two Z's?

320
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,583
Uh, yeah, two Z's.
- Two Z's.

321
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,125
And, Rory, I just--
I have to say, you're...

322
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,333
Rory's my favorite, so it's like...

323
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,500
Thank you.
- Really, yeah.

324
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,791
Thanks. Ah.

325
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,333
You know, I don't think
I ever got your name.

326
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,291
Hey, what's up?
- Hey, I'm good. Nice to meet you.

327
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,166
Uh, Zeke. Yeah.
- Zeke?

328
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,291
Thank you so much.

329
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,708
Hi. Wh-What's happening?

330
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,250
Do you guys...
- Oh, we met earlier.

331
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,333
Oh.
- In line for the bathroom.

332
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,666
Yes.

333
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,375
And you must be the daughter.

334
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,458
Uh, yeah, Izzy, yeah.

335
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,458
And, uh, this is...
- I'm, um...

336
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,250
Well, it's on the tip of my tongue,
I swear.

337
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,666
I mean, I literally forgot my own name.

338
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,000
It's Georgia. It's Georgia.
- My name is Georgia.

339
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,625
Nice to meet you, Georgia.

340
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,833
Uh, we've totally taken up
enough of your time.

341
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,500
Thank you so much.
- Aren't you gonna introduce me?

342
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,416
Oliver Hoyt-Knight, this is Izzy,
this is Georgia, Zeke...

343
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,541
Hey.

344
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,666
And...

345
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,333
still don't know your name.

346
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,875
I'm Solène.

347
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,166
Oh, is that, uh, is that French?

348
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,500
Uh, just French grandparents.

349
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,166
Solène, the big sister, I'm guessing?

350
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,291
Okay. Solène the mom.

351
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,833
Yes, my mom.

352
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,541
Uh, you don't look like my mom.

353
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,875
Okay.
- Hey, now, so...

354
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,416
It's just a fact. She's Black.
- She is Black.

355
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,833
She actually owns
a contemporary art gallery in Silver Lake.

356
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,875
You guys should, like,
come visit sometime.
I love art.

357
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,416
Yeah, in fact, wherever we go,
while everyone else is too hungover

358
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,250
to get out of bed,
Hayesy is out and about exploring.

359
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,875
Right? He's got a special penchant
for art museums.
Guys, I'm sorry.

360
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,166
You need to go. I'm so sorry.

361
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,625

Oh, there he goes.
- Honey, really? Okay.

466
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What? It's a milestone.

467
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,083
It is.

468
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,083
It is.
- It's a good question.

469
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:24,000
Um, it feels very, very sweet.

470
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,333
I don't know.
I think I just feel really grateful.

471

I'm glad to be here.
I'm grateful to be here.

472
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,666
Maybe confusing.

473
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,500
You know?

474
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,875
Um, I had Izzy when I was so young,

475
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:40,625
so I feel like I, like, disconnected
from my age, uh, in my 20s.

476
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,000
I mean, I was just out of college,
you know?
Sure.

477
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,500
Do you get it?
I think

478
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,208
you're not even a person until you hit 30.

479
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,375
I mean, just think about it, right?

480
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,291
And then you spend
the next ten years after that

481
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,041
trying to figure out
the type of person you want to be.

482
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,791
That is profound.
- That is drunk.

483
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,041
Well, let's drink
a little bit more. Hear, hear.

484
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,291
To life experience.

485
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,208
Yeah, let's put that spin on it.
- Hear, hear.

486
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,833
Hey, hey!

487
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,583
Birthday girl. Hi.

488
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,583
Whew, you startled me there.
- Yeah, I know.

489
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,291
Hi, Todd.

490
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,916
Hi. Um...

491
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,500
Listen, I just wanted to come over and say
that I-I really admire you.

492
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,041
Oh.
- Uh, you've built a community

493
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,416
around art and inclusiveness.

494
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,291
It's just-- that's so cool.

495
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,583
That's very sweet. Thank you.

496
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,958
So I teach high school science.

497
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,958
Oh, cool. What year are your students?

498
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,291
Oh, sophomores.

499
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,916
My daughter's gonna be a senior.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

500
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:37,583
And divorce, I mean,
it's such an identify shift, right?

501
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,291
Yeah.
- I totally get it.

502
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,333
I mean, who am I
if I'm not Jessica's husband?

503
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,708
Do you have any children?

504
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,791
I do.

505
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,916
That's my son Rosco.

506
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,666
Oh, he's so cute.

507
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,583
Charlie.
- Uh-huh.

508
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,833

509
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,833
Rupert.

510
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,791
How long ago did you guys split up?

511
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:07,166
"Split" is such a specific word.

512
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,375
I'm just gonna say it.

513
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:11,250
Uh, I would like you
to accompany me next week

514
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,375
to a restaurant for a meal of food.

515
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:16,875
It's been rocky for a while.

516
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,916
Let's put it that way.

517
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,875
Oh. Sorry.

518
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,666
It's her.

519
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,333
Hi, honey.

520
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,125
Yeah, I'll be home soon.

521
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,833
Solène. We need you up front.

522
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,500
Okay, okay. Just give me a second.

523
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,708
Really, Solène,
we need you up front, like, now.

524
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,958
Okay. Okay. Is everything all right?

525
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,166
Yeah, we just need you.

526
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,916
She really uses her inclusive space to--

527
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,375
Oh.

528
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,083
And there she is now.

529
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,541
Hey.

530
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,083
Hi.

531
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,583
I don't know if you remember me,
but we met in Coachella.

532
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,875
Yes, I remember you.

533
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,375
So you know each other.

534
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,750
Great. Um, can I get anyone anything?
Water? Coffee?

535
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,833
Thank you. We're all right, Jeremy.
- Oh. Yeah.

536
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,166
Bye.

537
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,291
Wow.

538
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,750
Um...

539
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,916
This is a surprise.

540
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:52,916
I did some online sleuthing
for a Solène of Silver Lake,

541
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:56,583
and, uh, well, I have
this very large, empty flat in London

542
00:25:56,583 --> 00:26:00,041
that, uh, desperately needs some artwork.

543
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:03,458
So I was thinking maybe you could, uh...

544
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,916
Okay. Um...

545
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,583
Why don't we start in the back
with the ceramics?

546
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,708
You know, I was hoping
you'd start with the ceramics.

547
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,708
Um...

548
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:18,458
So these pieces were thrown by a fantastic
potter we work with called Susan Hable.

549
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,500
Mm. She threw them at the wall?
- Sh--

550
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,791
N-No. She...

551
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,791
That's what they call it when they do
the work on the, on the wheel.

552
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:27,666
It's called throwing.

553
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:28,791
Right.
- Right.

554
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:30,458
Who is he?

555
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,333
That's Hayes Campbell
from August Moon.

556
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,083
Where have you been?

557
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,083
Being in my 30s, obviously.

558
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:41,125
The silhouettes of these pieces
echo Susan's fascination with, uh...

559
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,750
...gesture and movement.

560
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,500
Yeah, I can see that.

561
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,541
Yeah, her work's very popular.

562
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,416
I'm sure.

563
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:54,125
Great. Well, I will, um... just...

564
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:57,208
take all of... all of these ones.

565
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,791
Sorry, what do you mean?

566
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:05,333
Oh, just-just everything
in this general area would be great.

567
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,458
Claire.
- What's up?

568
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,791
So, um...

569
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:15,625
This client would like to buy
all these pieces.

570
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,333
Okay.

571
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,916
Hi, Claire.

572
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,958
Hey.

573
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,000
Thank you.

574
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,875
I'll get that all dealt with.

575
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,208
That's Claire.
- Mm. Seems nice.

576
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:32,250
She's very nice.
She's very hardworking, competent, single.

577
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,083
Sorry, what are these ones over here?

578
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,333
These took my fancy.

579
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,625
Hayes, I love you!

580
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,083
Um...

581
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,916
These pieces are by a local artist,
Amanda Friedman.

582
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,916
Uh, she lives in Eagle Rock.

583
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,041
She chose to feature,
um, a strong light source.

584
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,375
Mm-hmm.

585
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:55,333
As if aliens had just, uh, landed.

586
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,541
Hmm.

587
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,375
These are shot on
a medium and large format camera on film.

588
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,875
No digital manipulation.

589
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,625
So cool. I'll take them all.

590
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:06,250
What?
- If you could Bubble Wrap them
or whatever,

591
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,291
and then I'll send someone over later
just to pick them up.

592
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,583
These bowls, by the way, these are lovely.

593
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,541
Thank you.
- And the spaghetti tiles?

594
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:16,041
I mean, the detail i-is beautiful.

595
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,333
And whatever this is,
I want it in my home.

596
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,958
Honestly, uh...

597
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,458
I think I'll take all of it.

598
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,166
This is real art,
and these are real artists.

599
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,250
They take their work very seriously,
as do I.

600
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,500
They made it with a great deal of care,
and you're coming in here like--

601
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,750
I don't know--
like you're buying apples or something.

602
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,083
Honestly, I've been looking
for art like this for so long,

603
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:46,541
and-and I genuinely connect with it,
and so...

604
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,708
I-I would really like to buy it,
if it's okay with you.

605
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,500
Okay.

606
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,708
Okay.
- And for the record,

607
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:58,375
you have never seen me buy apples before.

608
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,166
It's fucked up.

609
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,125
So?

610
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,166
So?

611
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,583
Are you gonna show me something else?

612
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:14,666
Don't you have a football stadium
to get to or a photo shoot to attend?

613
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:17,250
Well, um, what's-what's the day today?

614
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,541
It's Tuesday.
- Yeah, no, don't have any of those
until Wednesday.

615
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,125
I actually would love to show you
some more art,

616
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,083
but you just bought
everything in the gallery.

617
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,916
Oh.

618
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,375
Well, that was incredibly rude of me.

619
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,250
Does that happen a lot?

620
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,333
Yeah.

621
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,375
Well, if you have nothing left to show me,

622
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,083
then I'm gonna have to go find
another art gallery

623
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,875
owned by a different art dealer...
- Okay. Okay.

624
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,208
I have a friend.

625
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:48,250
She's an artist I like very much.
She has a warehouse in Glendale.

626
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,541
She's not there right now,
but I happen to have the key.

627
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,958
I have been dying to go to Glendale
for the longest time.

628
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,583
You have no idea.
- Middle of nowhere Glendale?

629
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,125
The middle of nowhere is
my favorite place in the world.

630
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,875
Why don't you have your driver meet us
out back, and we'll go to Glendale.

631
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,458
I mean, we could just go in your car.

632
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,041
Sorry about the clutter.
- Oh. Uh, yeah.

633
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,291
I'll get that out of your way. Okay, um...

634
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,250
Okay, I'm in.
- Whoops.

635
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,916
I can take that.
- Oh, thank you.

636
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:15,500
Yeah, sure. Where do you want me to...

637
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,208
Just on the floor or...
- Floor?

638
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:19,875
Oh, yeah, the back. Sure, okay.
Okay.

639
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay.

640
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,041
Sorry about all this.

641
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,625
Oh.

642
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,000
Okay.
- Yeah.

643
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,291
And go.

644
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,958
Yeah.
- Okay.

645
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,750
Um...
- I'm coming up to the, uh, light.

646
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,833
So it's usually best if you just don't
look them in the eye.

647
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,041
Okay, great.
Just staring straight ahead.

648
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:42,541
They are really not noticing anything.

649
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,125
I think we're good.

650
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:47,333
That's kind of amazing.

651
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,583
Wow. You're a natural.

652
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,083
Hello.

653
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,166
Thanks.

654
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,250
I like these.
- Ah.

655
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,833
Natrice Miller. Fantastic.

656
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,541
Is this a painting?

657
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:26,291
Yes, it is.

658
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,916
What does it mean?
- It's a calendar.

659
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:30,500
No, don't do that.
- Don't what?

660
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,833
Do you really want the lecture
about how art is subjective?

661
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,875
What do you see?

662
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,166
It's a grid. It's grid-like.

663
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,708
It's-it's-it's numerical.

664
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:41,166
Which means that--

665
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,375
Please. I-I've got nothing.

666
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:49,458
So the artist calls this piece
a self-portrait.

667
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:52,000
Now, what's she's showing is that

668
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,791
she's not some, uh, untouchable genius
in a rarefied space.

669
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,666
This is her life as an artist.

670
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,541
I find its honesty incredibly moving.

671
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,708
This piece is from my friend Sarah.

672
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,875
Um, she's sending all of these
to a gallery show in New York,

673
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,208
but she never sends this one.

674
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,583
Hmm, why's that?

675
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,583
Um, I don't know. She doesn't want to.

676
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,333
Wow.

677
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:20,583
What's it called?

678
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,541
<i>Unclose me.</i>

679
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,083
What do you feel when you look at it?

680
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,958
Everything.

681
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,708
How did you meet Sarah?
- Uh...

682
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,833
Uh, in college. Freshman year.

683
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:51,250
She was, uh, blasting a Fiona Apple song
from her dorm room,

684
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,916
and I knew instantly we'd be friends.

685
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:56,708
Should we go?

686
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,333
And-and, um, college?

687
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,000
What'd you study?

688
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,875
Um, I was an art history major.

689
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,458
Although I started out as premed.
- A doctor?

690
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:10,750
Well, I was an 18-year-old people pleaser
from New Jersey,

691
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,083
and my parents really liked the idea.

692
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,791
But then I...

693
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:19,583
took an art history class for the credits,
and I fell in love.

694
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,458
Anyway.

695
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,583
What about you? What's your life story?

696
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,333
I'm sorry, was that your life story?

697
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,916
Partly.

698
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,500
Tell me, how does one find oneself
in a boy band?

699
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,833
Very random.

700
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,666
Uh, I auditioned.

701
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,916
Others did, too.

702
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:43,625
You know, we were just Polaroids
on a wall, really.

703
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,333
You know, you got Adrian,

704
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,875
million-dollar smile.

705
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:49,958
Rory, Aussie rebel.

706
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:52,583
Simon, brooding poet.

707
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:56,000
Ollie, you know,
Ollie's just got that swagger.

708
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,416
And what about Hayes?

709
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,666
Oh, I'm just English.

710
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,666
Just works a charm, really.

711
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:07,000
You know, the funny thing is, the same day
that I auditioned for the band,

712
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,500
I also auditioned to play Tiny Tim

713
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,208
in the Hackney Playhouse version
of <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

714
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,625
And in the end,
I didn't end up getting it.

715
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,875
You know, not tiny enough, apparently.

716
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,125
But I did get the boy band.

717
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:22,750
Had I got the play,
I would've done it, and...

718
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,416
...someone else would've been me
in the band.

719
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:30,541
And, uh, I would've been...

720
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,833
I don't know what I would've been.

721
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,416
God, I'm starving. Are you hungry?

722
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,041
We should go get a bite to eat.

723
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,666
I...

724
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,916
I'm not sure.

725
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:49,416
What... what do you mean?

726
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:53,833
I'm not sure what we're doing here

727
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:57,291
at a boiling hot warehouse in Glendale,

728
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:58,625
asking about my major.

729
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,750
Well, I told you. I-I love Glendale.

730
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:08,958
I feel like I don't meet people like you
very often.

731
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:13,166
And most people think
they already know me.

732
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,333
Hayes Campbell.

733
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,791
It's not me.

734
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,416
I don't know. You didn't seem to care.

735
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:26,208
And for what it's worth,
I think we met in a very interesting way.

736
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:31,333
I think you're smart and, you know,

737
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,625
y-you're also just-just...
y-you're hot, or whatever.

738
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,916
"Hot"?

739
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,458
Or whatever.

740
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:43,291
So I guess what I'm doing here is...

741
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,208
just trying to get to know you better.

742
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,000
Well...

743
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,666

So what should we eat?

750
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:14,125
Uh, we could go back to my hotel
in Beverly Hills,

751
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,916
order some room service.

752
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:19,208
Uh, that's... kind of a drive.

753
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,375
Yeah, no, I was just throwing out
some options.
- Mm.

754
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,833
I-I don't really know L.A.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

755
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:28,375
How about, um, All Time on Hillhurst?

756
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,916
That is Hayes Campbell.

757
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:36,000
Is that a popular spot?

758
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,375
Um, it's pretty popular, I guess. It's...

759
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:41,958
Okay, uh...

760
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:44,375
Actually, let's go to my house.

761
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,333
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.

762
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,583
Sounds good.

Here we are.

767
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,166
Wow.

768
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,958
It's a little, uh, bit messy.

769
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,708
Izzy's packing for camp, so, uh...

770
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,583
It's perfect. It's, um... it's a home.

771
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,791
Thanks.

772
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:22,791
Daniel hated-- uh, my ex,
hated it.

773
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,875
He called it a starter house.

774
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,375
But...

775
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,458
I always thought of it like a home, too.

776
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,958
Oh, shit.
- Is everything okay?

777
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:39,416
Yeah, everything's fine, sort of. It's...

778
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:42,125
Ah. Past the expiration date?

779
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,958
You know, I usually find those dates
to be more of a suggestion.

780
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:47,916
No, no, it's just-- it's--
my fridge is broken again.

781
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:50,625
So, um, I was just seeing
how long it's been down.

782
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:53,166
But if you just want to go, then I-I...
- Oh, no. Hell no.

783
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,166
Give it to me. Let me have a taste, yeah.
- What?

784
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:58,416
Oh, no, I mean, this has definitely got,
like, a week left in it for sure.

785
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,750
Oh, my God!

786
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,791
No, it doesn't.

787
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:04,708
Why would you do that?

788
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,250
No, that's yours.

789
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,625
Okay, uh, yeah.

790
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:10,708
Um... put me to work.

791
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:14,250
What? No. I'm not gonna let you smell-test
the contents of my refrigerator.

792
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,833
Woman, time is a-wasting. Put me to work.

793
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,708
It would be my honor.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

794
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,916
Uh, cooler from the garage,
we fill it with ice,

795
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:23,458
sort it into two categories:
salvageable and hazmat.

796
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:24,916
Okay, got it.

797
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:27,333
Oh, um, those sandwiches.

798
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,833
Do we still get those or...?

799
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,500
Let me get the cooler.

800
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,333
Tomato?
- Yes.

801
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,708
Thank you.

802
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,250
Your daughter, you, uh, close?

803
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,416
Yeah, we are.

804
00:38:56,541 --> 00:39:00,458
I mean, she is my daughter
and I am her mother,

805
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:04,583
so we do drive each other
up a wall sometimes, but, um...

806
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:05,958
but yeah.

807
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,125
She's my favorite person.

808
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,208
So what about you?

809
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,708
You and your parents, are you guys close?

810
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:15,291
Oh. No, not really.

811
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,916
I mean, they split up
when I was very young.

812
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:21,791
Mum remarried to, uh...

813
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:24,250
"Darren from Scunthorpe.

814
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,000
Good show, Hayes."

815
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,666
You're not a fan?
- I mean, he's nice enough.

816
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:28,750
He's just a twerp.

817
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,291
And he's from Scunthorpe,
which is a bit of a shithole.

818
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:36,333
He's-he's, uh, he's not bad really.

819
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,916
What about your dad?

820
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:39,583
Dad's wanted a lot more of a relationship
in the last few years,

821
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:41,250
which is really funny timing

822
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,833
given that he wasn't really there
for the first 16 years of my life.

823
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:47,791
Now he wants to be best mates.

824
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:49,583
Yeah.

825
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,291
I don't know.

826
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,583
I mean, I want to be close to him, but...

827
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,958
It's hard to trust people, isn't it?

828
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,458
Yeah.

829
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,000
This is very good.

830
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,166
Thank you.

831
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:12,958
This Daniel guy, ex-husband,
what happened to him?

832
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:14,083
Really?

833
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:17,916
Not even a softball question
to warm us up a little bit like,

834
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,500
"Hey, Solène, what's your favorite color?"

835
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,958
Hey, Solène,
what's your favorite color?

836
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:24,041
That's actually a very personal question.

837
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:28,291
For context, um...

838
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,000
...I had just moved to L.A.

839
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Um, I wanted to be in the art scene
in Downtown New York,

840
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,708
but I could afford to be in the art scene
in Downtown L.A.
- Mm.

841
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:42,875
So I met Daniel, uh,
at a party in Echo Park.

842
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,291
Hate him already.

843
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:46,625
It's getting late.
I think that maybe we should...

844
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:49,125
Solène.
- Mm-hmm. Hayes?

845
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,333
We're just talking.

846
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:54,500
We're two people with trust issues
who need to open up a little.

847
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,416
I mean, what's the worst that can happen?

848
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,125
Oh, you want to know the worst thing that
can happen when you open up to someone?

849
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,583
Please tell me.

850
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:05,291
Okay.

851
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,583
I'll tell you.

852
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:14,458
Daniel, he was very intelligent,
outgoing, very driven...

853
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:19,333
...and we really liked each other.

854
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:25,625
So we got together, fell in love,
got married, got pregnant...

855
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,833
Although not in that order.

856
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,791
And then we were just very young.

857
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,000
With a baby.

858
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,583
We, you know, put our heads down.

859
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,333
He was crushing it at work.

860
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:41,541
The gallery had finally opened,
Izzy was at school,

861
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:45,375
but there was, uh, distance.

862
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,500
It's-- we had-- there was a drift.

863
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,166
But I thought, you know,
"Okay, that's normal.

864
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,708
That's normal. You know?

865
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:58,125
So you didn't get a fairy tale. Grow up."

866
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:02,166
And then one night
about three years ago...

867
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:06,916
...we were out at dinner
with his work friends,

868
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:12,333
and, um, I was repeating some stupid...

869
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:15,583
gossip about, uh, someone we all knew,

870
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:19,708
who cheated on someone else,

871
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:21,791
and the whole table went silent.

872
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,458
Like, you know that feeling
when you walk into a room

873
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:29,541
and you know everybody
was just talking about you?

874
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:34,583
And I look at Daniel,
and he won't look at me.

875
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:38,208
He wouldn't look at me.

876
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,208
So we got back to the house,
paid the sitter,

877
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:44,458
and I asked him.

878
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,416
He said her name was Eva.

879
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:55,125
She was a...

880
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:57,041
young lawyer at his firm.

881
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:05,083
The thing that I'm the most angry about
is I was so nice about it.

882
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,750
I offered to forget it.

883
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:14,666
I said that, for us, for our family,
for the good of our family, I would--

884
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:17,333
I mean, people make mistakes--
I'll forget... I'll...

885
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,250
I'll forgive it.

886
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:25,625
And then he said...

887
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,583
...he didn't want to move past it.

888
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,458
He was in love.

889
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,166
And then he very quietly...

890
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,000
...left.

891
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,000
So that, in my experience,
is the worst thing that can happen

892
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,333
when you open yourself up to someone.

893
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,125
Well...

894
00:43:57,791 --> 00:43:59,875
...we're still here.

895
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,208
Mm-hmm.

896
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:06,333
Eating great fucking sandwiches.

897
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:09,208
They are great, aren't they?

898
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,750
And maybe we're not all Daniel.

899
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,166
I'll take that under consideration,
Hayes Campbell.

900
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,458
Oh, please not the first and last name.

901
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:20,000
Do you not like that?

902
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,791
It just doesn't tell the whole story.

903
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:27,750
I see that.

904
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,000
Just-- I'll be right back.

905
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:49,000
Hello.

906
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,083
Oh, hi, Izzy.

907
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:53,250
Hey-- uh, no.

908
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,500
Why'd you stop?

909
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,083
No reason.

910
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:02,291
What is that song?

911
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:04,666
Uh, it's-it's nothing, really.

912
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,916
I like it.

913
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,625
Yeah?

914
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,708
Yeah.

915
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,250
I'm too old for you.
- No, you're not.

916
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,875
Okay.

917
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:24,458
I could be your mother.
- You're not.

918
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,375
But I could be.
- But you're not.

919
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:34,083
No.

920
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:36,166
Can I take you back to your hotel?

921
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:43,125
Uh, no, it's fine. Desmond's outside.

922
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,375
So when can I see you again?

923
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,250
Hayes.

924
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,750
Solène.

925
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,250
I can't do this.
- Why's that?

926
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,791
Because you're you and I'm me,
and we just don't fit.

927
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:06,375
We'll see.
- Mm.

928
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:17,416
Glad you enjoyed the sandwich.

929
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,166
Legendary.

930
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,375
Hi. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

931
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:50,666
I know. I know. I'm packing.
- Yes, good. Okay.

932
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,625
Sup?

933
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:55,416
Are you okay?

934
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:56,500
I'm fine.

935
00:48:57,916 --> 00:48:59,166
Oh, my God, are you high?

936
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,458
No.

937
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,208
Did Tracy give you a gummy again?
- No.

938
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,208
I'm fine.

939
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,166
All right. And I'm packing,
so don't come in, please.

00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,875
No.

1037
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:15,625
I didn't know how to play an instrument
before I started the band.
- Mm.

1038
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:18,708
They told us it wasn't necessary.

1039
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,875
Yeah.

1040
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,416
You want to hear a story?

1041
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:26,333
Mm-hmm.

1042
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:29,333
A few years ago,

1043
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,500
the head of my label calls me.

1044
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:37,458
And he says that the lead singer
of my favorite band

1045
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:38,916
wants to meet me.

1046
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,291
I'm so excited.

1047
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:43,041
Maybe we'll hit it off,

1048
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,458
record a song.

1049
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:48,375
And I get there,

1050
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:52,083
and it's his ten-year-old daughter's
birthday party.

1051
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,541
And he wants me to take pictures with her
and all her friends.

1052
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:02,291
I think that's my greatest fear in life.

1053
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,666
That I'm a joke.

1054
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:09,083
You're not a joke.

1055
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,666

Morning.

1064
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:07,916
I hope you don't mind
that I borrowed your cardigan.

1065
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:10,541
It's only temporary. I will give it back.

1066
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,833
Oh, no complaints here.
- Okay. Just checking.

1067
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:26,875
I'm leaving this afternoon
to go on the European leg of my tour.

1068
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:29,833
Don't worry. I'll be out of your hair
before you know it.

1069
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,375
And I was really hoping
you'd come with me.

1070
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,500
You know I can't do that.

1071
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,625
Why not?

1072
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:41,333
Izzy.

1073
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:45,208
And I don't think it's...
- She's at camp all summer.

1074
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,916
The gallery, I-I have to,
you know, work...

1075
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:53,250
I literally bought all of the art
in your gallery, so, I mean...

1076
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:58,958
Don't your artists need
some more time to m-make some art?

1077
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:03,041
I don't have any clothes.

1078
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:04,750
I have an army of stylists, an army.
- No, no, no, no.

1079
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,041
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

1080
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:08,708
I did not bring enough underwear.

1081
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:11,416
Well, we can go to Target.

1082
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:13,458
And we'll get some Fruit of the Loom.

1083
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:14,916
That's what you wear, right?
Fruit of the Looms?
- Thank you.

1084
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:16,833
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1085
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,916
Thank you. Only the best.
- So...

1086
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:23,250
When was the last time
you took a real holiday?

1087
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,708
What about what people will say?

1088
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,375
I don't care what they say.

1089
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:43,083
And worse comes to worst,
we'll just say that you are my...

1090
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:46,291
extremely attractive art consultant.

1091
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,125
Everyone has secrets.

1092
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,750
Hi, Gene.

1093
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:14,125
Hey, everyone, this is Solène.

1094
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,125
She's my art consultant.

1097
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,708
Okay.

- Hi.

1099
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,833
Come on. We got to go.
- Uh, break a leg. Oh.

1100
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:00,333
Okay, this is for you. Ears.
- Thank you.

1101

1148
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:29,583
You embarrassed to be jet-setting around
the world with a 24-year-old pop star?

1149

Because that's-- it's fine.

No, it's fine, it's fine.

<i>Oui.</i>

1168
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:55,791
That was reckless.

1169
01:07:55,791 --> 01:07:56,958
We're in Paris.

1170
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:58,333
It's still reckless.

1171
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:00,458
It's still Paris.

1172
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:08,666
We have a long weekend coming up,
and Rory and Simon are going off to Ibiza,

1173
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:13,708
but Ollie and I rented this spectacular
house in the south of France.

1174
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:17,416
It's peaceful... quiet.

1175
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,791
And I think we could have a lot of fun.

1176
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:27,666
Okay, hold on.

1177
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,333
Ah. Oh.

1178
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,416
Wow.

1179
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:52,875
Okay.

1180
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:07,791
Oh.
- Is this a funeral?

1181
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:08,875
Hi.

1182
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:10,875
Hi.
- Hi.

1183
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:13,250
Is this Hayes's chair?

1184
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,458
Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:22,458
Ah.

1187
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:27,750
So, are you guys having fun on the tour?

1188
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:30,666
Mm-hmm. -Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. It's fun.

1189
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:34,416
Charlotte, how long have
you and Ollie been dating?

1190
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:36,208
Dating?

1191
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:39,500
We've been hanging out for a while.

1192
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,791
I'm getting popsicles. You guys want some?

1193
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,708
Oh, yeah.
- Yes.
- Okay, one, two.

1194
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:46,833
Do you want one?
- No, I'm good, thank you.

1195
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:49,208
Okay.

1196
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:50,500
Wait, pass one to me.

1197
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,833
Hey.
- Oh, my God, look at this.
- Hello.

1198
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:55,500
Excuse me. So sorry.

1199
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:57,958
Hi.
- Hey.

1200
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,500
Make some room?
- Make some room please.

1201
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:05,416
Hello.

1202
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,041
Hi.
- Hi.

1203
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:12,166
Please warm me.

1204
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:14,250
Okay.
- I'm done.

1205
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,250
This place is incredible.

1206
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,833
I plan to keep doing
absolutely nothing all weekend.

1207
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:19,875
Not sign an autograph, write a tweet.

1208
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:22,708
So, Ollie says you own an art gallery?

1209
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:24,083
Yeah, in Silver Lake.

1210
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:25,958
It's amazing.

1211
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:28,375
Solène's got a real eye for talent.
- No doubt.

1212
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:30,125
I hear you're a mom, too.

1213
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:31,458
Yes. Yes.

1214
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:33,791
Uh, I have a daughter, Izzy.

1215
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:35,333
She's, um, 16.

1216
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,750
I love that. Where does she go to school?

1217
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:40,333
Uh, she just finished her junior year
at Campbell Hall.

1218
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:41,833
Oh, my God.

1219
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:44,250
I have a friend who graduated
Campbell Hall two years ago.

1220
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,833
That's crazy. I wonder if she knows her.

1221
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:50,791
Now, that's hilarious.

1222
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:53,916
Charlotte, wha-- um, what do you do?

1223
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:55,666
I'm in college.

1224
01:11:55,666 --> 01:11:59,416
I'm taking a year off
to, you know, travel.

1225
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:01,958
Charlotte is being modest.
Okay, she's brilliant.

1226
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:03,500
She speaks like ten different languages,

1227
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,708
and plus she's an amazing dancer.

1228
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:08,333
I wonder what Rory
and Simon are doing.

1229
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:13,250
Simon, how many models
are with you right now?

1230
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,166
We're gonna have to do
something a little naughty

1231
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,541
to prove that we're having more fun.

1232
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:19,041
Orgies are still a thing, right?

1233
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:20,666
Ollie, can you not, please?
- I know, I know.

1234
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:23,916
Now that you're with Solène,
you're like a middle-aged man.

1235
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:26,916
You know, before you showed up,
he behaved like an actual pop star.

1236
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:29,916
Do you just say every fucking thing
that pops in your head?

1237
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:31,750
Popsicles.

1238
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,666
Come on, guys.

1239
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:40,541
Solène, how did you guys meet?
We need to know the story.

1240
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:43,250
Uh, we met at Coachella.

1241
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:45,625
Actually, it was at an August Moon
meet and greet.
- Yeah.

1242
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:48,000
Oh, my God. You're a Moonhead.

1243
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,791
No, no.
- That's so cute.

1244
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:51,625
It's actually kind of a crazy story.

1245
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:54,083
Uh, she wasn't supposed to be there.

1246
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:56,291
And then she was,
and she was with her daughter.

1247
01:12:56,291 --> 01:12:59,583
Yeah, yeah.
No, we-we, uh, we met by accident.

1248
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,750
By accident, yeah.

1249
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,916
In my trailer.

1250
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:05,416
And then Hayes, you know, really upped
the ante when he dedicated a song to me.

1251
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:07,041
"Closer"?

1252
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:09,583
Yes.
- Of course that was the one.

1253
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:12,958
We do that
when one of us finds a girl,

1254
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:15,375
or in Hayes's case, a woman, cute.

1255
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:18,416
We pretend to change the set list
at the last minute.

1256
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:21,250
It's a bit.
- It's a bit. Right.

1257
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:22,625
Oh, my God, wait. Oh, wait.

1258
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:24,375
Do you guys remember when he did it
for that Swedish actress

1259
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,916
who was, like, in love with him?

1260
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:27,333
Hayes told you that, didn't he?
- Mm-hmm.

1261
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,458
Hanna. Wasn't it Hanna, Hayes?
- Oh, my God.

1262
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:30,666
Poor Hanna. She was obsessed.

1263
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:32,916
I mean,
can you imagine if he did it?

1264
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:34,541
That would be so fucked up.

1265
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,833
She just kept showing up.

1266
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:39,166
We couldn't ditch her 'cause she was,
like, famous in Sweden or something.

1267
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:40,833
She was like 33 and clueless.

1268
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,583
It was, like, so awkward.

1269
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:44,916
Oh, shoot, I forgot my, um, thing.
- Just let me...

1270
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:47,750
I just need it. So excuse me.
Sorry. Just got to grab it.

1271
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,375
Enjoy the popsicles.

1272
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:51,541
Bye.
- Bye.
- See you.

1273
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:55,291
Why'd you do that?

1274
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,500
Do what?

1275
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:09,166
I'm sorry about Ollie.

1276
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:11,166
He can be a...
- It's fine.

1277
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,083
He's a guy in his 20s.

1278
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,375
What's that supposed to mean?

1279
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,875
It means I think it's time I went home.

1280
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:20,541
Hey, Sol, can we just take a beat...
- It's not you.

1281
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:22,083
It's me.

1282
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:25,416
You are very, very beautiful,

1283
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:27,458
and I fell for your fuck-boy move.

1284
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:28,833
40 and clueless, I guess.

1285
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:30,958
Can I explain myself? It was stupid.

1286
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:32,666
I was trying to impress you.
- And it worked.

1287
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:35,083
And it worked for Hanna, too. Nice job.

1288
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:37,000
I'm sorry, is it so shocking to you
that I've slept with other women?

1289
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,125
Other older women? No.

1290
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:41,083
It's even fine that you have a type.
- I actually liked Hanna.

1291
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,458
You know what, Hayes?
- Not that that's any of your business.

1292
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:45,666
I got swept up in the idea of you,
and it's been fun, it really has,

1293
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:48,166
but we both knew it had to end.
- Does it?

1294
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:50,000
Does it what? I...
- Does it have to end?

1295
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,500
W-We have a few more weeks of the tour,
then I'm gonna be in L.A.

1296
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,416
It would just be me,
and we could hang out like normal people.

1297
01:14:57,416 --> 01:15:00,333
Um, yeah, it's not gonna work for me.

1298
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:03,000
This was fun, but now it's, uh, not.

1299
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,875
Wh-What are you so afraid of, Solène?

1300
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:09,083
The father of my child
lied to me for a year,

1301
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,833
and all of his friends knew.

1302
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:12,958
Everybody knew except for me.

1303
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:16,541
Which is a gut punch similar to the one
I just felt by the pool with your friends.

1304
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:19,500
I'm not Daniel.
Tell that to my stomach.

1305
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,791
You know, I-I know what it is
that you're doing.

1306
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:24,125
You're bailing. You're running away.

1307
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,333
No, I'm not running away.

1308
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:28,250
Oh, you're not running away?

1309
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,041
You're literally packing a bag.

1310
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:32,000
Hayes, this doesn't
have to be dramatic, okay?

1311
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,541
We both knew what this was. It's fine.
- What if I want more?

1312
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:37,041
Wh--
- For the first time in

1313
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:39,791
I don't even fucking know how long,
I-I'm actually happy.

1314
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:44,125
I mean, usually, I feel numb or...

1315
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:47,791
you know, I-I feel like I'm supposed to be
feeling something when I'm not.

1316
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:50,625
But with you,

1317
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:54,708
laughing, just being with you,

1318
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:58,166
holding you at night, I mean,

1319
01:15:58,166 --> 01:15:59,833
it's meant the world to me.

1320
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:01,583
And I'm writing music.

1321
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:05,000
God, the music I'm writing now,
I-I actually feel like I care about it,

1322
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,500
so-so why on earth
would I want this to end?

1323
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:18,125
This is where you say, "Of course, Hayes,
I... I feel some of this, too."

1324
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,250
I can't say that.

1325
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:25,166
God, you know
what the crazy thing is, Sol?

1326
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:27,125
I don't think you ever
even gave us a chance.

1327
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:32,500
I mean, does anyone in your life
even know about me?

1328
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,416
Does your daughter? Do your friends?

1329
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:39,250
If the roles were reversed, do you think
anyone else would give a shit?

1330
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:40,375
Or judge?

1331
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:42,083
I mean, did anyone with Daniel and Eva?

1332
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:44,750
Izzy did. Tracy did. I did.

1333
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,791
I do.

1334
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:50,250
So, what, you're, um,
you're ashamed of me?

1335
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,375
Is that it?

1336
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:56,708
I... am...

1337
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,833
...ashamed.

1338
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,541
Um...

1339
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,583
Okay, well...

1340
01:17:11,666 --> 01:17:13,750
I'm going to go find
somewhere else to sleep tonight,

1341
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:17,250
and I'll arrange a flight back to L.A.

1342
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,833
<i>Izzy's turning 17.</i>

1343
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,375
Can you believe it?

1344
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:49,000
I got to say, I'm really surprised
you got her a new car, Daniel.

1345
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,333
It's not new. It's used.
I got it at CarMax.

1346
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:53,083
It's like new. Almost new.

1347
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:57,666
Well, we had a price cap,
so I bought her watercolors and an easel.

1348
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,791
Well, that's cool. I mean, you know?

1349
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:00,333
She's got something cute
and something powerful.

1350
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:02,833
Do you think she should,
like, just, like, come home to it?

1351
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:04,291
Um...
- Or, oh, no. I know.

1352
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:06,833
Framed photograph of the car wrapped up.

1353
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:08,291
You can give it to her
when you pick her up at camp.

1354
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:09,958
Okay.
- Great.

1355
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:12,000
Okay, ready? Okay.

1356
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,541
Oh, uh, do you remember
Kip Brooks from my old firm?

1357
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:17,791
Maybe. Why?

1358
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:21,291
Well, we had lunch
with him and his wife last week,

1359
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,958
and they were telling us about
this amazing trip that they took to Rome,

1360
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:27,041
and he said that he could've sworn

1361
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:30,375
that he saw you there in a café
with the kid from August Moon.

1362
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:33,208
Were you in Italy?
- Yes, I was.

1363
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:35,125
I was in Venice for the Biennale.

1364
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:37,458
Oh, right on.
Finally stepping up to the plate.

1365
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:38,958
Nice.

1366
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:42,125
Uh, thing is, he said that

1367
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:46,375
you guys were kissing and holding hands.

1368
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:50,541
And, I mean, that would just be, like,
mind-blowing if that were true.

1369
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:54,625
Yeah, that would be mind-blowing.

1370
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:57,541
Um, he is a client.

1371
01:19:57,541 --> 01:19:59,166
He's been by the gallery.

1372
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:02,000
Okay, well, I mean,
I'm sure we can all agree

1373
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,125
that any relationship with
a 24-year-old world-famous pop star

1374
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:09,875
would be crazy on, like, so many levels.

1375
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:14,083
Well, I'm not really interested
in relationship advice from you, Daniel.

1376
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:17,583
But in this case,
I do agree it would be crazy.

1377
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:22,250
Okay, I'm gonna go
snap some pics of the car.

1378
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,541
Please know I'm not unaware
of his, uh, stunning...

1379
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:32,291
hypocrisy.

1380
01:20:32,291 --> 01:20:33,625
Cool.

1381
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:37,833
I'm leaving him.

1382
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:43,208
He obviously has no idea yet, but, um...

1383
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:45,083
Yeah, it's over between us.

1384
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:48,666
Um, why are you telling me this?

1385
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:52,083
Because I wanted you to know the truth.

1386
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,041
Would you want to get Thai food
with me sometime?

1387
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:58,333
No.
- Okay.

1388
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,875
Thank you so much.

1389
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:05,125
<i>The food,</i>

1390
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:09,041
the people-watching, the art,
uh, it was...

1391
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:10,375
it was Europe.
Mm-hmm.

1392
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:12,041
Who's this guy you were with?

1393
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:16,416
He's a pretty high-profile client,
so I probably shouldn't name names.

1394
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:17,875
So it's strictly professional?

1395
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,750
Well, this client...

1396
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,916
he's very young.

1397
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:25,416
How young are we talking?

1398
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:27,833
20s.

1399
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:29,000
Mid-20s.

1400
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,583
Oh, okay. That's nothing.

1401
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:34,541
I mean, if you were gonna tell me
something happened,

1402
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,083
I'm just saying, that's nothing.

1403
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:37,500
Okay, so hang on.

1404
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:42,166
Um, when Daniel does it, it's gross,
but if I were to do it, it would be fine?

1405
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:44,583
Yeah. Because I hate him and I love you.

1406
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,000
<i>You live there
and obviously enjoy living there,</i>

1407
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,541
<i>but there must be things you miss.</i>

1408
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:51,708
<i>I miss British humor.
I mean, you know.</i>

1409
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:52,833
<i>Yeah. [laughing]</i>

1410
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:57,333
<i>Our humor is this--
just doesn't always travel.</i>

1411
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:48,750
Hi. Hi. Solène Marchand?
- Yes.

1412
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,375
Brenda McCall, Dana's mom.
- Oh.

1413
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:52,375
I think she's in a bunk
with your daughter.
- Yes, yes.

1414
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:54,333
Izzy has mentioned Dana.
Hello. How are you?

1415
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:56,250
Can I just tell you, you are my hero.

1416
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,375
Also divorced.

1417
01:23:57,375 --> 01:24:01,250
You have inspired me not to lie about
my age on my Hinge profile, so...

1418
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,916
Well...

1419
01:24:02,916 --> 01:24:04,250
Uh, you're even prettier in person.

1420
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:06,375
Um... Oh. No, no. It's-- No, no.
- Can I get a selfie?

1421
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,625
Thanks so much.
- Neil, stop.

1422
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,958
What? Come on. What...
- Can we just trade places?

1423
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,625
Neil.
- What did I do?

1424
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:15,583
Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

1425
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:19,958
I have to tell you, my daughter has had
a crush on Hayes since she was like ten,

1426
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:22,583
and she is so heartbroken.

1427
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,125
Yeah.

1428
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:37,125
We talked like
a million times, Mom.

1429
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:38,750
You never said anything.

1430
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:42,291
I mean, I could tell something
was going on.

1431
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:44,375
I didn't tell anyone.

1432
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:49,875
I kept thinking,
"I'm just gonna have this experience,

1433
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:51,750
and no one will ever know."

1434
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,291
Mom, it's Hayes Campbell.

1435
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:55,208
You're right.

1436
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:57,291
You're right.

1437
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:01,250
We're not dating anymore.

1438
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:04,166
I mean, I don't know if we... Anyway.

1439
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:06,458
I ended it ten days ago.

1440
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:08,500
Which is what's so crazy
about all of this.

1441
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,666
Wait, wait, you broke up with him?
- Yes.

1442
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:13,833
Wow.

1443
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:15,000
Okay.

1444
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:22,291
You know, I could have handled
that you were dating him.

1445
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:24,791
It pisses me off that you lied to me.

1446
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:27,750
Like, Dad lied, and that sucked.

1447
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:31,708
I thought I could count on you.

1448
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:36,625
I am so, so sorry.

1449
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:39,916
It will never happen again. I promise.

1450
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:45,333
People on the Internet that are
picking you apart are disgusting.

1451
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:48,041
It's 'cause you're a woman,
and it's 'cause you're older than him.

1452
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:49,666
They hate you for it.

1453
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,166
So that's just hypocritical and unfair.

1454
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:54,333
And wrong.

1455
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,750
You like him?

1456
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:10,375
Yeah, I do.

1457
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,458
Is he a feminist?

1458
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:15,041
'Cause that's important here.

1459
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:18,666
I mean, he is still a guy...
- Right.

1460
01:26:18,666 --> 01:26:20,583
...but, um...

1461
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:25,041
...but, yeah,
he's a feminist.

1462
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:26,750
Mom.

1463
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:31,375
Why would you break up
with a talented, kind feminist?

1464
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,916
Because...

1465
01:26:39,083 --> 01:26:40,833
Where's he now?

1466
01:26:40,833 --> 01:26:43,708
He's in L.A., I think.

1467
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,500
So?

1468
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:51,208
What are you gonna do?

01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,583

1483
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:52,625
Hi.

1484
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:56,333
Hi.

1485
01:27:57,416 --> 01:27:58,500
You okay?

1486
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:02,250
It was horrible...

1487
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:05,291
but... seems to have died down.

1488
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:12,500
What I am not okay with
is how I treated you.

1489
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:15,958
I'm sorry.

1490
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:18,833
When you said this is the part

1491
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:21,625
where I was supposed to say
that I felt all those things, too...

1492
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:25,458
...I was afraid.

1493
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:31,375
I do, very much...

1494
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:34,541
...feel all those things.

1495
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:38,750
With you, I feel...

1496
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:43,125
...everything.

1497
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:45,500
So...

1498
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:50,333
...maybe you're right.

1499
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,625
Maybe it doesn't have to end.

1500
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:58,333
I'm sorry, Solène. I, um...

1501
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,250
I wasn't expecting this.

1502
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,791
Of course. I...
- I'm feeling a little overwhelmed
right now

1503
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:04,750
with everything that's going on,
you know?

1504
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:07,583
I totally understand.
- I just need a moment.

1505
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:09,125
You know.

1506
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:17,958
All right, I've had a moment.

1507
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:24,250
<i>It's gonna be a lot.</i>

1508
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:26,583
We're ready.

1509
01:29:26,583 --> 01:29:28,958
There's gonna be
a firestorm of attention on us.

1510
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:31,458
We'll just delete all our social media.
- You sure?

1511
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,083
Ignorance is bliss.

1512
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:34,583
This feels good.

1513
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:37,666
So.
- So.

1514
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:39,583
I don't think I can delete TikTok.

1515
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,291
Do I have to delete TikTok?

Hey.
- Hey.

You must be Daniel. I'm Hayes.

Mm.

1533
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:02,833
I'm sorry to hear about Eva, mate.

1534
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,541
That, um, sucks.
- Yeah.

1535
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:06,916
Wh-Where's Izzy? I'm taking her to school.

1536
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:08,875
I will let her know.

1537
01:31:08,875 --> 01:31:11,291
I just put a pot of coffee on.
You want a cup?

1538
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:13,958
No, thank you. I'm fine.

1539
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:17,291
You know, there's a dozen photographers
out there across the street.

1540
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:18,500
Yeah, we know.

1541
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:22,041
Um, my head of security just installed
some pretty incredible cameras,

1542
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:23,291
so we should be fine.

1543
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:25,083
Security. Okay.

1544
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:28,666
Um, what's your endgame here, bro?

1545
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:30,791
"Bro"?

1546
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:32,500
Didn't realize we were
on bro terms, Daniel.

1547
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,500
I don't know what you want me
to say to you, man.

1548
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,750
I mean, how long are you gonna keep up
this insanity with my wife?

1549
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:39,916
Daniel?

1550
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:41,125
What are you doing here?

1551
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:43,458
I'm gonna go get Izzy.

1552
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:45,958
Thanks.

1553
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:49,625
It was really nice to have met you, bro.

1554
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:55,083
What's up?
- What's up?

1555
01:31:55,083 --> 01:31:58,333
I don't know-- just thought I'd like to
check to make sure our daughter is safe

1556
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:01,291
from crazy fans and paparazzi
while she's here at her mother's home.

1557
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:03,125
Of course we all want that.
- Oh.

1558
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:06,000
Which is why we have security,
and Izzy understands

1559
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,625
this is all gonna blow over,
and she says she's fine with it.

1560
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,375
Well, then you got it all covered, huh?

1561
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:11,833
Pretty much.

1562
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:14,250
You know,
I think I'll drive her to school today.

1563
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:15,750
That's great.

1564
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,666
I'll pick her up.
- Fine.

1565
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:19,125
Is that all?

1566
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:24,083
Is there something
you'd like to say, Daniel?

1567
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:26,000
As a matter of fact, there is.
I mean, you're my w--

1568
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:30,833
You're the mother of my child,
and you're screwing this kid

1569
01:32:30,833 --> 01:32:33,125
that she's had a poster of next to her bed
since she was ten.

1570
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:34,583
I mean, it's a little fucking weird.

1571
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:36,291
First of all, I'm not your wife.

1572
01:32:36,291 --> 01:32:39,750
I was your wife,
and you lied, cheated and left.

1573
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:42,583
The only reason that I met Hayes
was because you thought a business trip

1574
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,833
was more important than
a bonding experience with your daughter.

1575
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:47,708
I had to go to Houston.
- Yes, I know, Daniel! I know that!

1576
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:50,458
It's work-- I get it--
but it is also a choice!

1577
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:53,166
And that is the choice
that you repeatedly make for yourself,

1578
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:56,916
so excuse me if this whole white knight
routine is falling a little flat.

1579
01:32:56,916 --> 01:32:58,708
Ooh, zing.

1580
01:32:58,708 --> 01:33:00,791
Also, she never had a poster of Hayes
in her bedroom.

1581
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:04,000
It was Rory. It was always Rory.

1582
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,875
Sol, c-can you hear yourself?

1583
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,833
I mean, come back to reality
for just a moment here.

1584
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:09,500
Do you have any idea
what they're saying about you?

1585
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,416
No.

1586
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:14,291
Wow, okay.

1587
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:17,333
Um, I'll be outside.

1588
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:24,166
Hey.
- Bye, Mom.

1589
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:25,250
You okay?

1590
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,000
Yeah, no, I'm just running late.
- Okay.

1591
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,958
I'm gonna pick you up, all right?
- Okay.

1592
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:30,333
Ready? Okay?
- Yeah.

1593
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:31,791
Hey, sweetheart!

1594
01:33:31,791 --> 01:33:33,833
Over here, over here!

1595
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:35,500
Come on, guys.

1596
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:38,625
Take a break.

1597
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:03,375
You all right?
- Huh?

1598
01:34:03,375 --> 01:34:05,125
Uh...

1599
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:07,250
What's the matter?

1600
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,625
Um...

1601
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:12,666
Charlotte just texted me from New York.

1602
01:34:12,666 --> 01:34:15,750
Ollie's, um... he's got himself
in a bit of trouble.

1603
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,083
Is he all right?
- Yeah.

1604
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:20,125
I-I'm gonna pack a bag
and go and see him this afternoon.

1605
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:23,166
And I'm really sorry. This is so...
- Oh. Okay. Okay.

1606
01:34:23,166 --> 01:34:24,625
...last-minute and crazy.

1607
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,416
I-I understand. Go.

1608
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:27,625
You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

1609
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,583
Okay. It's-it's just gonna be
a few days, all right?

1610
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:31,458
All right.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry about this.

1611
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:39,750
I can't do anything about the phone stuff,

1612
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:43,583
but I'll put up a "by appointment only"
sign to keep out weirdos.

1613
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:45,083
Okay, that's a good plan.
Would you, um...?

1614
01:34:45,083 --> 01:34:47,625
Tracy, hi. Come in, come in, come in.
- Hi. Uh...

1615
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,416
Hi.

1616
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:54,041
What's with the horde?
- Um, okay.

1617
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:57,541
People are, uh, having feelings.

1618
01:35:00,166 --> 01:35:02,541
You're okay?

1619
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:05,208
I mean, I didn't know my being happy
would piss so many people off.

1620
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:07,791
Oh, right. Did I not warn you?

1621
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:09,875
People hate happy women.

1622
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:11,875
It's kind of a lot.

1623
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:14,291
Sol, it's almost 3:00.
- Oh, God. Okay.

1624
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:16,375
Uh, sorry, I got to pick up Izzy
from school.
- No.

1625
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:18,708
We're-- it's a thing,
and she hates when I'm late.

1626
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:29,416
Bye, Izz!

1627
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:36,458
Honey, what's going on?
- Drive, Mom.

1628
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:39,708
Well, who are those...
- Just drive please.

1629
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,916
Honey, what happened back there?

1630
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:49,708
Oh, those were just some seniors

1631
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:53,458
asking if you could get a picture
of Hayes's penis for them.

1632
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:56,666
So, you know, just a regular Tuesday.

1633
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:58,833
They said that?
- No, actually.

1634
01:35:58,833 --> 01:36:00,958
Uh, they said "dick."

1635
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:07,000
Then there's that guy in band, Trevor,
you know, that I really like.

1636
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,583
Well, we've been texting.

1637
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:14,250
And I thought he liked me, too, but then
you know what he said to me today?

1638
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:18,041
"Tell your mom I turn 18 in a month."

1639
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:20,166
So, yeah, that's how my day was.

1640
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:24,208
Oh, Izz.

1641
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:28,083
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1642
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:30,208
Can you just drop me at Dad's?

1643
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:33,000
I just can't deal today.
- Okay.

1644
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,583
Um...

1645
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:50,208
Love you.

1646
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,250
You have time for a comment?

1647
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:21,083
What do you have to say
to the fans of August Moon?

1648
01:37:21,083 --> 01:37:24,833
What do you have to say to all the fans
in the world who are brokenhearted?

1649
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:43,958
<i>Hey, Sol, this is Jodie.</i>

1650
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:46,583
<i>Do you want to comment
on these latest stories?</i>

1651
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:50,166
<i>You know, given the tenor of them,
you might want to say something.</i>

1652
01:37:50,166 --> 01:37:51,750
<i>All right? Give me a call back.</i>

1653
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:38,083
Hey, you. How you doing?
- Hey.

1654
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:40,541
Oh, God.

1655
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:45,208
I tell you, that flight, oy.

1656
01:38:45,208 --> 01:38:46,333
I am so tired.

1657
01:38:46,333 --> 01:38:49,041
Mwah.

1658
01:38:49,041 --> 01:38:51,458
There you go.
- Oh, thank you very much.

1659
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:55,333
Why'd you give me the watch?

1660
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:57,416
And why aren't we moving?

1661
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,375
Hey.

1662
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:03,708
Sol, Sol, what's wrong?

1663
01:39:03,708 --> 01:39:06,625
I can't do this anymore.

1664
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,875
Us, our relationship, I...

1665
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:12,916
I can't do it anymore.

1666
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
It's Izz.

1667
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:23,125
Okay, um...
It's just...

1668
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,625
It's too much for her.

1669
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:31,000
I mean, it's... it's actually insane.

1670
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,458
I mean, she didn't sign up for
any of this, and it's too much for her.

1671
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:37,125
And I have to put her first.

1672
01:39:39,208 --> 01:39:40,416
Okay.

1673
01:39:41,416 --> 01:39:43,416
Okay, let me just, um...

1674
01:39:44,833 --> 01:39:47,250
Let me just think about this for a second.
Um...

1675
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,833
I mean, look, I-I could quit.

1676
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:53,791
I could quit all of it.
- No, you can't.

1677
01:39:53,791 --> 01:39:55,500
I'm f--
I'm fine with doing that.

1678
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:56,666
I could do that.

1679
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,458
It would just get worse.

1680
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:10,458
Please don't do this, Solène. Please.

1681
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:12,208
Please just go.

1682
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:14,791
You're not gonna fight for us?

1683
01:41:32,583 --> 01:41:35,333
I auditioned for the band when I was 14.

1684
01:41:40,333 --> 01:41:42,125
It shouldn't ruin a whole life.

1685
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,000
It's not going to.

1686
01:41:49,833 --> 01:41:52,500
You're gonna have a big, beautiful life.

1687
01:41:56,541 --> 01:41:58,291
I'm so sorry.

1688
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:04,000
I love you, Solène.

1689
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:08,916
I love you, too.

1690
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:55,375
Just promise me
you'll revisit this in five years.

1691
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:59,916
Izzy will be out of school,
living her best life.

1692
01:44:01,333 --> 01:44:04,541
And I'll be some D-list celebrity
that nobody gives a shit about.

1693
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:10,250
It's too long.

1694
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:16,916
If you get a shot at happiness,
you take it.

1695
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:18,833
And I will, too, okay?
