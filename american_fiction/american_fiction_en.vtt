1
00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:51.458
<i>Okay, let's begin.</i>

2
00:00:57.298 --> 00:00:58.507
Who wants to start?

3
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.885
Yes, Brittany, kick it off.

4
00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:04.847
I don't have a thought
on the reading,


5
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.850
I just think that that word
on the board is wrong.


6
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.854
Well, I think it still has
two G's in it last I checked.


7
00:01:13.022 --> 00:01:14.440
It's not funny.

8
00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:16.650
We shouldn't have to stare
at the N-word all day.


9
00:01:18.027 --> 00:01:19.028
Uh, listen,

10
00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.197
this is a class
on the literature


11
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:23.574
of the American south.

12
00:01:23.657 --> 00:01:24.825
You're going to encounter

13
00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.578
some archaic thoughts,
coarse language,


14
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:29.371
but we're all adults here

15
00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.707
and I think
we can understand it


16
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.918
within the context
in which it's written.


17
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.046
Well, I just find
that word really offensive.


18
00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.548
With all due respect, Brittany,

19
00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.801
I got over it,
I'm pretty sure you can too.


20
00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:43.844
Well, I don't see why.

21
00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:50.309
Right.

22
00:01:50.392 --> 00:01:52.519
Now, does anyone else have any

23
00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:53.687
thoughts
on the reading?


24
00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:00.277
Well, it made some of
your students uncomfortable.


25
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.071
When did they all become
so goddamn delicate?


26
00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:03.864
This wasn't
an isolated incident.


27
00:02:03.948 --> 00:02:04.990
What?

28
00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:06.533
Last month
you asked a student


29
00:02:06.617 --> 00:02:08.535
if his family had been Nazis.

30
00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.120
Yeah, I did, he's German,

31
00:02:10.204 --> 00:02:11.664
we were reading
<i>The Plot Against America</i>


32
00:02:11.747 --> 00:02:14.249
and trust me, by the way
he was squirming, they were.


33
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.542
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:18.420
Um, Monk, you are
a very talented writer,


35
00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:20.422
we're fortunate
to have you here.


36
00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:22.967
What? He hasn't
published in years.


37
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.593
I have written three novels

38
00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.178
since the last time
you published.


39
00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:28.055
Yeah, this is true,
and the speed
with which you write


40
00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:29.765
only proves
that good things take time.


41
00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.184
- Oh, go to hell, Monk.
-  Relax, Mandy.


42
00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:33.727
Yeah, relax, Mandy.

43
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:35.521
And anyway, my new book
is with Echo


44
00:02:35.604 --> 00:02:37.690
and my agent says
they're very excited about it.


45
00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:39.525
Oh, that's great to hear.

46
00:02:39.608 --> 00:02:42.236
- What's it about?
- Can we stop stalling, Leo?


47
00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:44.863
Um...

48
00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:46.115
Listen, Monk,

49
00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:49.827
we'd like to
give you a break.


50
00:02:53.747 --> 00:02:54.790
What do you mean, break?

51
00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.083
Just some time off.

52
00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:57.918
Mandatory time off.

53
00:02:58.002 --> 00:03:00.587
It's just, you're already
going to Boston
for the festival, right?


54
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.214
Why don't you
just stay there for--


55
00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:04.174
Because I hate Boston,
my family's there.


56
00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:05.843
Well, you need
some time to relax.


57
00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.386
You're on edge, man.

58
00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:08.929
You're under the impression
that time spent


59
00:03:09.013 --> 00:03:11.265
with my family
will take the edge off.


60
00:03:11.348 --> 00:03:12.933
- I'm fine.
-  You're not fine.


61
00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:14.893
I saw you crying
in your car last week.


62
00:03:14.977 --> 00:03:16.603
He punched
the steering wheel.


63
00:03:16.687 --> 00:03:17.980
Oh, wow.

64
00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:21.775
You know, if you spent
less time spying on me,


65
00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.318
you could

66
00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:25.404
probably write
a dozen more novels


67
00:03:25.487 --> 00:03:27.031
that people buy
at airports


68
00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:29.158
with their neck pillows
and Cheez-Its.


69
00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:31.744
Oh, here we go. Okay.
You want to go, dirty doggy?


70
00:03:31.827 --> 00:03:33.370
Okay, well, enjoy Boston.

71
00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:35.706
You can... you can get my book
at the airport.


72
00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.916

Welcome back.
How's it feel to be home?


87
00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:47.736
<i>Great.
Already had a guy</i>


88
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.988
<i>in a Bruins jersey
ask me if I think
I'm better than him.</i>


89
00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:51.907
That's good luck here.

90
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.701
<i>That's Boston's version
of a ladybug landing on you.</i>


91
00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:57.496
Any news?

92
00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:59.998
Patrick at Echo is passing.
But who fucking cares?


93
00:05:00.082 --> 00:05:02.000
<i>He's an old alcoholic.</i>

94
00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:04.002
- What is that? Nine now?
-  <i>He says,</i>


95
00:05:04.086 --> 00:05:06.380
"This book is finely crafted

96
00:05:06.463 --> 00:05:09.133
with fully developed
characters and rich language,


97
00:05:09.216 --> 00:05:12.678
<i>but one is lost to understand
what this reworking of</i>


98
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:15.430
Aeschylus' <i>The Persians</i>
has to do


99
00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:16.807
with the African-American
experience?"


100
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.933
<i>There it is.</i>

101
00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:19.560
There it is.

102
00:05:19.643 --> 00:05:20.686
<i>They want
a Black book.</i>


103
00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:22.020
They have a Black book.

104
00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:24.481
I'm Black, and it's my book.

105
00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:25.899
You know what I mean.

106
00:05:25.983 --> 00:05:28.485
<i>You mean they want me
to write about</i>
a cop killing some teenager


107
00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.821
or a single mom in Dorchester
raising five kids.


108
00:05:30.904 --> 00:05:33.448
Dorchester is pretty white now.
But yes.


109
00:05:34.283 --> 00:05:35.409
Jesus Christ. You know,

110
00:05:35.492 --> 00:05:37.703
I don't even really believe
in race.


111
00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:40.372
<i>Yeah. The problem
is that everyone else does.</i>


112
00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.377
<i>Anyway, have fun
at the book festival.</i>


113
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.381
<i>And just don't insult
anyone important. Please.</i>


114
00:05:53.427 --> 00:05:55.721
Writing from
a historical perspective


115
00:05:55.804 --> 00:05:57.890
doesn't mean that you can't

116
00:05:57.973 --> 00:05:59.683
make work
that doesn't resonate


117
00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:01.476
with today's audiences.

118
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.980
Yeah, I think of things like
<i>Game of Thrones</i> as proof that


119
00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:08.317
nerds like us
can still find great success.


120
00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:13.363
Unfortunately, we're going
to have to end it there.


121
00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:15.574
Thank you to our authors

122
00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:17.826
and thanks to all of you
for attending.


123
00:06:19.828 --> 00:06:20.787
Um...

124
00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:24.291
Is it just me,
or was this small


125
00:06:24.374 --> 00:06:26.084
even for a book festival?

126
00:06:26.168 --> 00:06:28.545
Yeah, it's because
we're up against Sintara.


127
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:30.339
Who?

128
00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:32.466
Sintara Golden.
You haven't read her?


129
00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.469
No, what's her book called?

130
00:06:37.888 --> 00:06:40.057
Raves everywhere.

131
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.351
<i>The Post, Bookforum.</i>

132
00:06:42.434 --> 00:06:43.936
The <i>London Review
of Books</i> said,


133
00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:46.271
<i>"We's Lives in Da Ghetto</i>

134
00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:49.566
is a heartbreaking
and visceral debut."


135
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.361
Plus a little birdie told me
that perhaps


136
00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:55.447
there's a TV adaptation
in the works?


137
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.658
- No comment.

138
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:59.868
Okay, it was worth a shot.

139
00:07:00.827 --> 00:07:02.871
Tell us, what was
your life like


140
00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.665
before you were an author?

141
00:07:04.748 --> 00:07:07.167
Well, I did undergrad
at Oberlin


142
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:11.213
and moved to New York
the day after graduation


143
00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:13.048
and a couple months later,

144
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:15.133
I was an assistant
at a publisher.


145
00:07:15.217 --> 00:07:17.761
And did
that assistant experience
shape your writing?


146
00:07:17.844 --> 00:07:21.848
Absolutely. Yeah,
I was a first reader meaning


147
00:07:21.932 --> 00:07:24.768
I would read
all the manuscripts
in the slush pile


148
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:27.854
and send them up the ladder
if they were any good.


149
00:07:27.938 --> 00:07:30.524
Some of them were great,
most were not.


150
00:07:32.943 --> 00:07:35.779
But the feeling
I couldn't shake was that


151
00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:38.782
no matter how good
the books were,


152
00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:43.412
most every submission
was from some white dude
from New York


153
00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:44.538
going through a divorce,

154
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:47.624
and too few of them
were about my people.


155
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.751
And so I think,

156
00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:51.753
"Where are our stories?"

157
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.215
You know,
"Where's our representation?"


158
00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:57.509
And it was from that lack

159
00:07:57.592 --> 00:07:59.428
that my book was born.

160
00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:03.307
Would you give us the pleasure
of reading an excerpt?


161
00:08:06.393 --> 00:08:07.394
Thank you.

162
00:08:12.816 --> 00:08:15.068
"'Yo, Cheranda,

163
00:08:15.152 --> 00:08:17.195
where you be goin'
in a hurry likes that?'


164
00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.990
Donna aks me when she see me
comin' out the house.


165
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.493
'Ain't none ya business,

166
00:08:23.577 --> 00:08:26.747
but if'n you gots to know,
I's goin' to the pharmacy.'


167
00:08:28.123 --> 00:08:30.625
I looks back at the door
to see if Mama comin' out.


168
00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:35.255
'The pharmacy?
What for?' she aks.


169
00:08:36.423 --> 00:08:38.133
'You know', I says.

170
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:41.011
'Nah', she say.

171
00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:45.640
'Hell, nah!
Girl, you be pregnant again?'


172
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.894
'Might's be', I tells her.

173
00:08:49.853 --> 00:08:51.646
'And if I is,

174
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.816
Ray-Ray's gonna be a real
father this time around.'"


175
00:08:58.153 --> 00:08:59.237
Thank you.

176
00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:04.701
Yes!

177
00:09:46.785 --> 00:09:48.078
-  Hi...
-  Hi.


178
00:09:48.161 --> 00:09:49.704
I'm here
to see Lisa Ellison.


179
00:09:49.788 --> 00:09:50.831
Uh, do you have
an appointment?


180
00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:51.957
We're about to close.

181
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.583
No, I'm her brother.

182
00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:54.709
-  Oh.

183
00:09:54.793 --> 00:09:55.752
There she is.

184
00:10:00.757 --> 00:10:01.842
Hello, Monk.

185
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:05.762
Hi, Lisa.

186
00:10:14.563 --> 00:10:17.190
Okay, you're in a boat,
the motor cuts out,


187
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.860
but you're in shallow water,

188
00:10:19.943 --> 00:10:22.446
but you're wearing
$600 shoes, but...


189
00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:25.782
your ride to the airport

190
00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:27.826
is just pulling away
from the beach,


191
00:10:27.909 --> 00:10:31.496
why, oh, why
is this a legal issue?


192
00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:35.459
I don't know.

193
00:10:37.294 --> 00:10:38.753
It's a matter
of row versus wade.


194
00:10:38.837 --> 00:10:40.005
Oh, my God.

195
00:10:42.048 --> 00:10:43.800
I think that's one of my best.

196
00:10:43.884 --> 00:10:44.885
Wow.

197
00:10:46.928 --> 00:10:47.929
Okay.

198
00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:53.768
- When did you start
smoking again?
-  Mm...


199
00:10:55.729 --> 00:10:57.063
Right after the divorce.

200
00:10:58.815 --> 00:11:00.358
I always hated Larry.

201
00:11:00.442 --> 00:11:01.693
Oh, I know.

202
00:11:01.776 --> 00:11:03.028
You told me
right when we started dating.


203
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:04.488
Do you remember
how mad I got?


204
00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:05.822
"It's not
your business who I fuck!


205
00:11:06.448 --> 00:11:07.491
Who I fellate."

206
00:11:07.574 --> 00:11:09.951
I definitely
did not say "fellate."


207
00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.245
I thought you did.
That's how I heard it anyway.


208
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.956
It's good to see you.

209
00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:18.502
Yeah, it's good
to see you too.


210
00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:23.215
How's work?

211
00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:25.383
It's not very glamorous.

212
00:11:26.843 --> 00:11:29.387
I go through
a metal detector every day.


213
00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:32.766
Well, what you do
is important.


214
00:11:32.849 --> 00:11:33.850
Well...

215
00:11:35.018 --> 00:11:36.853
Meanwhile, all I do is

216
00:11:36.937 --> 00:11:38.605
invent little people
in my head,


217
00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:41.399
then make them have imaginary
conversations with each other.


218
00:11:41.483 --> 00:11:44.277
Books change people's lives.

219
00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:46.696
Did something I've written
ever change your life?


220
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.198
Absolutely.

221
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:49.950
Absolutely.

222
00:11:51.743 --> 00:11:53.995
My dining room table
was wobbly as hell


223
00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.413
before your last book
came out.


224
00:11:55.497 --> 00:11:57.165
- Oh, my God. All right.
- It was, like, perfect.


225
00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:58.500
- Yeah. Oh, God.
- I'm telling you and--


226
00:11:58.583 --> 00:12:00.126
Take me back to Logan, please.

227
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.503
- Logan cannot help you, Monk.

228
00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:03.463
- Oh, my God!

229
00:12:04.381 --> 00:12:05.757
Welcome home, baby!

230
00:12:11.972 --> 00:12:13.223
Hello!

231
00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:15.350
Hello!

232
00:12:19.729 --> 00:12:22.607
- Mr. Monk!
-  Lorraine!


233
00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.694
Oh.

234
00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:27.904
You know how
that makes me feel.
It's just Monk.


235
00:12:27.988 --> 00:12:29.364
Oh, don't do that to me,

236
00:12:29.447 --> 00:12:32.075
you know I'm too old
to learn new names.


237
00:12:32.158 --> 00:12:34.160
- How you doing, Miss Lisa?
- I'm good.


238
00:12:34.244 --> 00:12:37.080
- You look good, Mr. Monk.
- Oh, I look fat.


239
00:12:37.163 --> 00:12:39.499
Oh, that's
the California talking.


240
00:12:39.583 --> 00:12:41.042
I took you
to Arkansas right now,


241
00:12:41.126 --> 00:12:42.544
- you'd be a beauty queen.
- Ooh!


242
00:12:42.627 --> 00:12:44.546
-  Is that my Monkie?
- That's frightening.


243
00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:52.971
-  Hi, Mother.
-  Oh.


244
00:12:54.055 --> 00:12:56.516
- You look fat.
- Ah, I know.


245
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.184
You ready
to go to dinner, Mrs. Ellison?


246
00:12:58.268 --> 00:13:00.395
Uh, I just need my purse
and my black cardigan.


247
00:13:00.478 --> 00:13:01.563
All right,
I'll get it.


248
00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:03.231
- Are you all right?
- Oh.


249
00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:05.025
You overeat
when you're depressed.


250
00:13:05.108 --> 00:13:06.776
I'm not depressed,

251
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.571
I've just been
not sleeping well lately


252
00:13:09.654 --> 00:13:11.323
and so,
fell off my exercise routine.


253
00:13:11.406 --> 00:13:12.490
-  Mm.
- Here.


254
00:13:12.574 --> 00:13:14.117
So you're
not depressed.


255
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.245
You just wear
all the hallmarks
of depression.


256
00:13:19.289 --> 00:13:20.373
I missed you.

257
00:13:23.043 --> 00:13:24.044
Is Larry coming?

258
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.130
No, Mother.

259
00:13:28.298 --> 00:13:30.884
Larry and I are separated, remember?

260
00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:33.511
- Of course, I remember.
- Okay.


261
00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:36.056
I just thought
he might join us.


262
00:13:37.307 --> 00:13:38.433
To see your brother.

263
00:13:39.142 --> 00:13:40.143
Okay.

264
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:44.898
I mean, is it really
such a big deal?


265
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:46.191
Everyone forgets things.

266
00:13:46.274 --> 00:13:47.776
Doesn't mean
she's sick necessarily.


267
00:13:47.859 --> 00:13:49.361
People forget
dentists' appointments.


268
00:13:51.404 --> 00:13:53.073
She forgets
I'm not married anymore.


269
00:13:53.948 --> 00:13:55.033
That's weird.

270
00:13:57.327 --> 00:13:58.828
What do you suggest we do?

271
00:13:58.912 --> 00:14:00.121
Why do I have to decide?

272
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.582
- Because you're a doctor.
-  So are you.


273
00:14:02.666 --> 00:14:03.875
I'm not that kind.

274
00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.253
Okay, my point is,
you are an intelligent adult.


275
00:14:08.505 --> 00:14:10.048
And I'm tired
of being the only person


276
00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:11.174
that takes care of her.

277
00:14:11.257 --> 00:14:12.384
Well, I don't recall anyone

278
00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:14.010
assigning you
that responsibility.


279
00:14:14.094 --> 00:14:16.262
No, you and Cliff just fled
west as soon as you could


280
00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:18.181
and left me
as caretaker by default.


281
00:14:18.264 --> 00:14:19.683
My work's there.

282
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:21.142
-"My work's there." Yeah.
- Apologies that it prevents me


283
00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:24.187
from keeping up
with the family melodrama.


284
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.564
If you lived up the block,
you wouldn't know
what was going on.


285
00:14:26.648 --> 00:14:29.192
I'm stuck here taking care
of that old house and finding


286
00:14:29.275 --> 00:14:31.236
love letters
from Dad's affairs.


287
00:14:31.319 --> 00:14:33.363
- His what?
-  His affairs.


288
00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:35.115
You didn't know
he was having affairs?


289
00:14:35.198 --> 00:14:37.617
No. How did you?

290
00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:39.828
Well, he was an OBGYN

291
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:41.371
that was
traveling constantly,


292
00:14:41.454 --> 00:14:43.415
but his patients were
in Boston.


293
00:14:43.498 --> 00:14:44.916
He said he was going
to conferences.


294
00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:47.961
He was making
house calls.


295
00:14:48.044 --> 00:14:50.171
Do you know that I saw him
kiss a white woman


296
00:14:50.255 --> 00:14:51.881
in the park in high school?

297
00:14:52.632 --> 00:14:53.550
How white?

298
00:14:53.633 --> 00:14:54.843
What do you mean, "How white?"

299
00:14:54.926 --> 00:14:56.970
Like Brahmin white
or Southie white.


300
00:14:57.053 --> 00:14:59.848
I don't know.
She had thin lips.


301
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:01.266
She looked like a bad kisser.

302
00:15:02.809 --> 00:15:03.852
Did you tell Mother?

303
00:15:03.935 --> 00:15:06.646
No. I wasn't going
to blow up our lives.


304
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.398
She's coming back. Mom. Mom.

305
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:09.441
Mom. Mom.

306
00:15:09.524 --> 00:15:10.525
Hi.

307
00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:14.320
How you doing?

308
00:15:15.363 --> 00:15:17.282
Our waitress
isn't wearing a bra.


309
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:18.950
Okay.

310
00:15:19.534 --> 00:15:20.493
I didn't notice.

311
00:15:23.872 --> 00:15:25.123
<i>See this shit?</i>

312
00:15:25.206 --> 00:15:26.875
<i>This gonna take us out
of the ghetto.</i>


313
00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.460
<i>But there are rules
in the house.</i>


314
00:15:28.543 --> 00:15:31.212
<i>Number one, never leave
this product in the house.</i>


315
00:15:31.296 --> 00:15:33.339
<i>And number two,
get your own crew.</i>


316
00:15:33.423 --> 00:15:35.592
<i>Number three, got to have
discipline in your crew.</i>


317
00:15:35.675 --> 00:15:38.178
<i>Number four,
don't praise a nigga too much.</i>


318
00:15:38.261 --> 00:15:39.846
<i>Otherwise he's gonna
think you're soft.</i>


319
00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:42.974
<i>Rule number five,
don't show no love.</i>


320
00:15:43.057 --> 00:15:44.768
<i>
- Love will get you killed.</i>

321
00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:47.270
<i>See this, it's like a bitch.</i>

322
00:15:47.353 --> 00:15:50.231
<i>You fuck a bitch,
don't let a bitch fuck you.</i>


323
00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:52.192
<i>You're a man
who don't need nothing.</i>


324
00:15:52.275 --> 00:15:53.610
<i>No one will get you through.</i>

325
00:15:53.693 --> 00:15:56.112
<i>This bitch? This bitch
will take your soul.</i>


326
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.615
<i>You niggas ain't got no fam...</i>

327
00:16:05.997 --> 00:16:08.583
Excuse me, uh, Ned.

328
00:16:08.666 --> 00:16:11.002
Do you have any books
by the writer
Thelonious Ellison?


329
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:16.508
Yeah, this way.

330
00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:22.806
- Here you go.
- Right.


331
00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:24.349
Yeah.

332
00:16:24.432 --> 00:16:26.434
Wait a minute,
why are these books here?


333
00:16:26.976 --> 00:16:28.186
I'm not sure.

334
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:32.607
I would imagine
that this author
Ellison is... Black.


335
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.318
That's me. Ellison. Yeah.

336
00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:39.697
He is me,
and he and I are Black.


337
00:16:39.781 --> 00:16:41.074
Oh, bingo.

338
00:16:41.157 --> 00:16:43.284
No bingo, Ned, these books

339
00:16:43.368 --> 00:16:45.787
have nothing to do
with African-American studies,


340
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.163
they're just literature.

341
00:16:47.247 --> 00:16:49.123
The blackest thing
about this one is the ink.


342
00:16:51.376 --> 00:16:53.837
I don't decide what sections
the books go in.


343
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.714
No one here does.
That's how chain stores work.


344
00:16:57.507 --> 00:16:59.008
Right, Ned.

345
00:17:00.093 --> 00:17:01.761
You don't make the rules.

346
00:17:02.512 --> 00:17:04.222
Hm.

347
00:17:04.305 --> 00:17:06.683
I'm just going to put them
back after you leave.


348
00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:08.434
Don't you dare, Ned.

349
00:17:08.518 --> 00:17:10.854
Do not you dare.

350
00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:14.107
Ned.

351
00:17:22.115 --> 00:17:23.575
Monk, what are you doing?

352
00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:28.872
Mom's only going
to get worse.


353
00:17:31.124 --> 00:17:32.375
They say mental exercise
is good,


354
00:17:32.458 --> 00:17:33.835
that's why I got her
that gardening book.


355
00:17:35.211 --> 00:17:37.380
Does growing cucumbers
count as mental exercise?


356
00:17:38.131 --> 00:17:39.382
I hate when you do that.

357
00:17:39.465 --> 00:17:41.509
What?

358
00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:43.761
You share your condescending
opinion as a question


359
00:17:43.845 --> 00:17:45.597
trying to disguise
the condescension.


360
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.931
Why don't you just say

361
00:17:47.015 --> 00:17:48.141
that you think
that gardening is idiotic?


362
00:17:48.349 --> 00:17:50.393
- Uh, because that's not
what I was doing.
- Bullshit.


363
00:17:50.768 --> 00:17:52.061
Bullshit. Bullshit.

364
00:17:54.647 --> 00:17:57.233
Maybe we can hire a nurse
a few times a week.


365
00:17:57.317 --> 00:17:58.276
Who's going to pay for that?

366
00:17:58.359 --> 00:17:59.944
You... you can't afford it?

367
00:18:00.778 --> 00:18:02.530
Not after the divorce,
I cannot.


368
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.825
- Well, it will hurt,

369
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:07.994
but we'll probably have
to sell the beach house.


370
00:18:08.077 --> 00:18:10.663
Yeah, we definitely need
to sell the beach house,


371
00:18:10.747 --> 00:18:12.040
but that money is going to go

372
00:18:12.123 --> 00:18:13.958
to pay back
the reverse mortgage


373
00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:16.127
that our mother took out
on the other house.


374
00:18:18.004 --> 00:18:19.005
Yeah.

375
00:18:22.175 --> 00:18:23.301
Look, I can send
some money home,


376
00:18:23.384 --> 00:18:24.469
but it's not going to be much.

377
00:18:24.552 --> 00:18:25.803
Can't Cliff chip in?

378
00:18:25.887 --> 00:18:27.347
Cliff's not in
a good place, okay?


379
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.015
Who is? Okay?

380
00:18:29.098 --> 00:18:31.559
Monk, Becca took everything.

381
00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:34.354
And the kids are getting
teased at school.


382
00:18:34.437 --> 00:18:35.605
- I didn't know.
-  Well...


383
00:18:36.397 --> 00:18:37.607
Maybe you should call him.

384
00:18:43.363 --> 00:18:45.365
I'm sorry I've always been
so distant.


385
00:18:50.578 --> 00:18:52.830
You couldn't help that.

386
00:18:52.914 --> 00:18:54.499
You were always
Dad's favorite.


387
00:18:56.918 --> 00:18:58.378
And that made Cliff
and I bond,


388
00:18:58.461 --> 00:18:59.587
and you resented us

389
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.923
for having that bond,
and then...


390
00:19:02.006 --> 00:19:03.841
I don't know, you just
became self-sufficient.


391
00:19:06.928 --> 00:19:07.929
You never talked about this.

392
00:19:08.012 --> 00:19:09.597
We never talked
about anything.


393
00:19:11.808 --> 00:19:13.267
Is that surprising?

394
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:14.811
Look at our parents.

395
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.854
Mm-hm.

396
00:19:16.938 --> 00:19:19.983
The only emotions
I remember from Dad...


397
00:19:22.652 --> 00:19:24.779
were boredom and rage.

398
00:19:25.446 --> 00:19:26.781
Is boredom an emotion?

399
00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:30.076
Great.
It's Detective Dictionary.


400
00:19:30.159 --> 00:19:32.453
-  Oh!

401
00:19:32.537 --> 00:19:33.955
You haven't called me that
in forever.


402
00:19:34.038 --> 00:19:35.415
Oh, God!

403
00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:38.501
- What? Oh, come on!
-  Oh, God!


404
00:19:41.212 --> 00:19:43.673
- Lisa? You okay? Hey.

405
00:19:46.592 --> 00:19:48.261
- Hey, help! Help!

406
00:20:46.402 --> 00:20:48.529
"If you are reading this

407
00:20:48.613 --> 00:20:51.866
it's because I,
Lisa Magical Ellison...


408
00:20:53.409 --> 00:20:54.452
have died.

409
00:20:57.538 --> 00:20:59.415
Obviously, this is not ideal...

410
00:21:00.708 --> 00:21:02.960
but I guess it had
to happen at some point.


411
00:21:05.046 --> 00:21:06.422
Hopefully, I...

412
00:21:09.217 --> 00:21:11.886
Hopefully, I expired

413
00:21:11.969 --> 00:21:16.432
under the heaving thrusts
of a sweaty Idris Elba


414
00:21:16.516 --> 00:21:19.227
or perhaps in a less
dignified manner,


415
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.022
under the heaving thrusts
of a sweaty Russell Crowe."


416
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.317
"Irrespective of how I went,

417
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.112
I ask that
those closest to me...


418
00:21:30.905 --> 00:21:32.657
not mourn all that much.

419
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.827
I lived a life
that made me proud.


420
00:21:37.036 --> 00:21:38.037
I...

421
00:21:39.038 --> 00:21:40.331
I was loved...

422
00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:43.501
and I loved in return.

423
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:48.297
I found work
that aroused my passions.


424
00:21:48.381 --> 00:21:51.092
I believe I gave more
than I took.


425
00:21:51.175 --> 00:21:53.719
And I did my damnedest
to help people in need.


426
00:21:55.138 --> 00:21:56.639
And on top of all that,

427
00:21:56.722 --> 00:21:59.851
many a friend wrongly
accused me of having Botox


428
00:21:59.934 --> 00:22:03.020
because of how tight my skin
stayed well into my 50's.


429
00:22:04.188 --> 00:22:06.315
What more could someone
ask of a life?


430
00:22:08.359 --> 00:22:09.360
I love you all.

431
00:22:10.611 --> 00:22:12.321
Thank you
for being here today.


432
00:22:15.449 --> 00:22:16.450
Goodbye.

433
00:22:18.536 --> 00:22:19.704
Lisa."

434
00:22:25.835 --> 00:22:26.961
Cliff?

435
00:22:52.737 --> 00:22:54.280
Are those human remains?

436
00:22:55.448 --> 00:22:56.699
You guys have
a permit for that?


437
00:22:56.782 --> 00:22:58.451
Just shut the fuck up,
Phillip.


438
00:22:58.534 --> 00:23:00.244
Cliff, you don't talk
to me like that.


439
00:23:00.328 --> 00:23:01.579
Fuck you. I just did.

440
00:23:01.662 --> 00:23:02.872
-  What?
- You want me to beat your ass?


441
00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:04.207
- I'm just--
- Get the fuck out of here.


442
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.209
I will eat your sweater vest
for dinner.


443
00:23:06.292 --> 00:23:07.793
- No-- Yep.
-  Bitch. Go. One.


444
00:23:07.877 --> 00:23:09.128
Get the fuck
out of here, Phillip.


445
00:23:09.212 --> 00:23:10.630
-  I'm just--
- Two.


446
00:23:10.713 --> 00:23:12.590
- Three.
-  Always been
a fucking douche.


447
00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:32.985
Where is everybody?

448
00:23:33.903 --> 00:23:35.529
They're exhausted.

449
00:23:35.613 --> 00:23:37.698
I gave Lorraine something
to help her sleep.


450
00:23:37.782 --> 00:23:38.908
Mother's taking a bath.

451
00:23:38.991 --> 00:23:40.117
Then I'm going
to dose her too.


452
00:23:41.869 --> 00:23:44.664
You think maybe I can get
some of that later tonight?


453
00:23:44.747 --> 00:23:46.540
Yeah. What,
you're not sleeping well?


454
00:23:47.583 --> 00:23:48.834
Uh...

455
00:23:48.918 --> 00:23:51.254
Normally, I sleep fine,
but just lately.


456
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.882
Yeah.

457
00:23:54.966 --> 00:23:57.927
Does seeing a dead body
ever become normal?


458
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.553
I don't know.
I haven't seen many.


459
00:23:59.637 --> 00:24:00.763
Really?

460
00:24:00.846 --> 00:24:02.473
I'm a plastic surgeon.

461
00:24:02.556 --> 00:24:04.767
If I'm looking at a corpse,
then something went very awry.


462
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:07.270
Right.

463
00:24:09.605 --> 00:24:11.357
Yeah. Made me feel for Mother.

464
00:24:13.067 --> 00:24:15.778
Can't imagine what
she must've gone through
finding Dad...


465
00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:19.323
you know, like that.

466
00:24:19.407 --> 00:24:20.408
I know.

467
00:24:21.784 --> 00:24:23.202
So much death.

468
00:24:31.294 --> 00:24:33.754
When was the last time
we were here together?


469
00:24:35.256 --> 00:24:36.716
Uh...

470
00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:38.259
Maybe ten years.

471
00:24:38.342 --> 00:24:39.552
Yeah.

472
00:24:39.635 --> 00:24:40.803
The kids were still little.

473
00:24:41.637 --> 00:24:42.638
Yeah.

474
00:24:45.516 --> 00:24:47.268
How is your family,
by the way?


475
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:50.271
You actually care?

476
00:24:50.354 --> 00:24:52.982
Of course. Why would I ask?
Why would you ask me that?


477
00:24:53.065 --> 00:24:54.734
I don't know, Monk.
You never really called.


478
00:24:54.817 --> 00:24:56.777
- I get busy.
- Yeah, everybody gets busy.


479
00:24:57.737 --> 00:24:58.946
You drift away.

480
00:25:01.073 --> 00:25:02.575
You want to know
how my family is?


481
00:25:02.658 --> 00:25:05.369
My wife left me
'cause she caught me
in bed with a man.


482
00:25:06.412 --> 00:25:08.581
She took my house,
half my practice.


483
00:25:09.373 --> 00:25:11.125
My kids fucking hate me.

484
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:14.170
And I still live
in fucking Tucson.


485
00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:17.882
What was wrong with Tucson?

486
00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:19.633
Oh, my God.
There's one gay bar


487
00:25:19.717 --> 00:25:21.010
and it's full of college kids.

488
00:25:21.093 --> 00:25:23.137
One of them asked me
if I was Tyler Perry.


489
00:25:24.263 --> 00:25:25.348
That's terrible.

490
00:25:25.431 --> 00:25:27.808
I mean, Tyler Perry
lives in Atlanta, right?


491
00:25:27.892 --> 00:25:29.310
Fuck you, man.

492
00:25:31.145 --> 00:25:32.146
Shut up.

493
00:25:32.229 --> 00:25:33.230
Nowhere near Tucson.

494
00:25:33.981 --> 00:25:35.441
Oh, boy.

495
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:39.779
Did you know
Dad had affairs?


496
00:25:39.862 --> 00:25:41.322
Oh, for sure.

497
00:25:41.405 --> 00:25:42.615
How?

498
00:25:43.574 --> 00:25:45.534
You could just tell.

499
00:25:45.618 --> 00:25:48.454
Lisa told me she saw him
kissing a white woman once.


500
00:25:48.537 --> 00:25:52.083
Why did I have no idea?
Why am I the last to know?


501
00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:54.251
Because you loved him
too much.


502
00:25:54.335 --> 00:25:56.629
Enemies see each other
better than friends.


503
00:26:00.299 --> 00:26:01.717
What the hell
did you give her?


504
00:26:01.801 --> 00:26:04.345
It's oxycodone.
But knocks them right out.


505
00:26:04.428 --> 00:26:05.930
You gave her opioids to sleep?

506
00:26:06.013 --> 00:26:07.848
Yeah. You ever seen
a heroin addict?


507
00:26:07.932 --> 00:26:09.266
Those guys take naps
standing up.


508
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.476
It's dangerous.

509
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.144
Look, I'm keeping
an eye on her.
I'm a doctor.


510
00:26:12.228 --> 00:26:13.396
-  So am I.
- Right.


511
00:26:13.479 --> 00:26:15.689
Maybe if we need
to revive a sentence.


512
00:26:15.773 --> 00:26:21.070
Well, why do you have
synthetic smack anyway?


513
00:26:25.366 --> 00:26:26.450
What is that?

514
00:26:32.623 --> 00:26:33.749
Oh.

515
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.044
Oh, shit.

516
00:26:38.921 --> 00:26:39.922
Mother?

517
00:26:42.341 --> 00:26:43.342
Mother?

518
00:26:48.722 --> 00:26:50.349
Hey.

519
00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:53.185
Hey. What are you doing? Hey.

520
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.021
Mother.

521
00:26:57.731 --> 00:26:58.732
Hey.

522
00:27:05.614 --> 00:27:06.866
Come on.

523
00:27:09.326 --> 00:27:10.327
Come on.

524
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:14.206
Well, I'm not sure,
to be honest with you.


525
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.833
It's going to depend
on what the doctors say.


526
00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:18.836
Yeah, I'll touch base
when I know more.


527
00:27:20.087 --> 00:27:21.714
Thanks so much
for being understanding.


528
00:27:23.883 --> 00:27:27.386
Hey, um, Leo, one more thing.

529
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.263
I was wondering
if maybe we could treat this


530
00:27:29.346 --> 00:27:32.016
as a sabbatical as opposed
to a leave of absence?


531
00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:33.184
Whatever happens
with my mother,


532
00:27:33.267 --> 00:27:34.268
it's going to cost some money.

533
00:27:37.396 --> 00:27:38.522
No, I understand.

534
00:27:39.315 --> 00:27:40.441
No, it's not your fault.

535
00:27:41.317 --> 00:27:42.610
I'll figure something out.

536
00:27:43.402 --> 00:27:44.403
Yeah.

537
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.946
Thanks for your help.

538
00:27:46.405 --> 00:27:47.615
Okay. Bye-bye.

539
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.367
Oh.

540
00:27:54.413 --> 00:27:55.414
Oh.

541
00:27:56.123 --> 00:27:56.999
Uh...

542
00:27:57.082 --> 00:27:58.209
You don't have to do that.

543
00:27:58.292 --> 00:27:59.668
Oh, no. I do.

544
00:27:59.752 --> 00:28:01.504
It's tomato season.
You can't let them go to waste.


545
00:28:01.587 --> 00:28:03.297
- Ooh.
- A crime around here.


546
00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:06.759
Thank you.

547
00:28:06.842 --> 00:28:08.302
That's what neighbors
are for, right?


548
00:28:08.385 --> 00:28:09.678
Welcome to the neighborhood.

549
00:28:11.222 --> 00:28:12.806
I thought the place
was vacant.


550
00:28:13.766 --> 00:28:16.435
Uh, it has been for a while.

551
00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:18.020
We just got here last night.

552
00:28:18.103 --> 00:28:20.731
Oh. Figured the place
was haunted.


553
00:28:20.814 --> 00:28:23.776
They said some old man
blew his brains out there
a while back.


554
00:28:26.695 --> 00:28:27.821
Yeah.

555
00:28:30.699 --> 00:28:33.160
Oh, my God. I...

556
00:28:35.204 --> 00:28:36.497
I'm a fucking idiot.

557
00:28:37.331 --> 00:28:38.582
Please forgive me.

558
00:28:38.666 --> 00:28:39.667
Well...

559
00:28:41.377 --> 00:28:42.753
Oh, I'm very sorry
to hear that.


560
00:28:43.629 --> 00:28:44.630
What'd she do for a living?

561
00:28:45.422 --> 00:28:48.175
She was a doctor. Um...

562
00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:52.471
Most of my family, doctors.
Basically, I'm the outcast.


563
00:28:54.765 --> 00:28:56.433
Um, what do you do for work?

564
00:28:56.517 --> 00:28:57.434
I'm a lawyer.

565
00:28:58.143 --> 00:28:59.895
Public defense. Quincy.

566
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.022
Very honorable.

567
00:29:02.106 --> 00:29:05.943
Yeah. It's very hard,
but can be rewarding.


568
00:29:07.236 --> 00:29:08.779
May I ask you something

569
00:29:08.862 --> 00:29:11.240
that I'm sure a lot
of people ask you?


570
00:29:11.323 --> 00:29:13.701
How do I feel about defending
guilty people?


571
00:29:14.243 --> 00:29:15.202
Yeah.

572
00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:17.496
- I love it.
- Why?


573
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.541
I have to.
And they're all guilty.


574
00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:23.627
- Really?
- Yes. But that's okay.


575
00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:25.629
People are more
than their worst deed.


576
00:29:27.715 --> 00:29:28.966
I guess I agree with that.

577
00:29:29.049 --> 00:29:31.176
Mm. Sure you do.

578
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.469
You're a writer.

579
00:29:32.553 --> 00:29:34.096
I don't follow.

580
00:29:34.179 --> 00:29:36.890
Well, writers have
to be non-judgmental.


581
00:29:36.974 --> 00:29:39.143
You can't write
interesting characters


582
00:29:39.226 --> 00:29:41.520
and be critical of every
bad decision they make.


583
00:29:41.604 --> 00:29:42.563
Right?

584
00:29:42.646 --> 00:29:43.772
Maybe you should
be the writer.


585
00:29:43.856 --> 00:29:45.149
I don't feel
like much of one lately.


586
00:29:45.858 --> 00:29:46.984
You blocked?

587
00:29:48.902 --> 00:29:50.738
It's just...

588
00:29:50.821 --> 00:29:53.240
I don't think anybody
wants to buy what I write.


589
00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:54.408
That's not true.

590
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:56.201
I didn't want to say anything,

591
00:29:56.285 --> 00:29:58.370
but, um, I actually read
one of your books.


592
00:29:59.455 --> 00:30:01.165
Hm. Which?

593
00:30:01.248 --> 00:30:02.541
<i>The Frogs.</i>

594
00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:03.584
Oh, so you were the one.

595
00:30:03.667 --> 00:30:05.294
I liked it.

596
00:30:07.046 --> 00:30:08.047
You're talented.

597
00:30:15.095 --> 00:30:16.847
You're expecting company?

598
00:30:18.474 --> 00:30:19.475
Yeah.

599
00:30:19.558 --> 00:30:21.393
- Oh.

600
00:30:29.568 --> 00:30:30.819
Hello.

601
00:30:31.612 --> 00:30:34.031
- Hey.
- Jelani, uh, this is Monk.


602
00:30:34.114 --> 00:30:36.575
He and his family own
the house across the street.


603
00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:37.826
Nice to meet you.

604
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.703
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

605
00:30:39.787 --> 00:30:40.704
Are you staying for dinner?

606
00:30:41.497 --> 00:30:42.498
Uh...

607
00:30:42.581 --> 00:30:44.249
No, I need to go check in
on my mother.


608
00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:45.459
Cool.

609
00:30:46.043 --> 00:30:47.211
Thank you, uh...

610
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:52.383
For the wine, and...

611
00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:54.677
good night.

612
00:30:57.388 --> 00:30:58.389
Good night, Monk.

613
00:31:50.023 --> 00:31:51.525
What time's your flight?

614
00:31:51.608 --> 00:31:52.693
11:00.

615
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.614
You think, uh, maybe
you could change it?


616
00:31:57.698 --> 00:31:59.032
Think it would be useful
to have you


617
00:31:59.116 --> 00:32:00.409
at Mother's doctor's
appointment today.


618
00:32:00.492 --> 00:32:01.660
I can't. I got to get home.

619
00:32:03.787 --> 00:32:05.706
Fine, but you think
you can chip in


620
00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:07.249
for her care
once we find out what's what?


621
00:32:07.332 --> 00:32:08.625
It's probably going
to be pretty expensive.


622
00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:10.794
Things are tight
right now, so...


623
00:32:10.878 --> 00:32:12.212
You thought
about firing Lorraine?


624
00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:16.800
Lorraine is family.

625
00:32:17.593 --> 00:32:18.886
Well, shit, Monk.

626
00:32:18.969 --> 00:32:20.304
I don't know
what to tell you, all right?


627
00:32:20.387 --> 00:32:21.597
So you can't do anything?

628
00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.474
I will check
with my accountant


629
00:32:23.557 --> 00:32:24.850
when I get back, all right?

630
00:32:25.642 --> 00:32:26.852
It's 8:00 in the morning.

631
00:32:26.935 --> 00:32:28.896
I'm not flying
the fucking plane, Monk.


632
00:32:33.484 --> 00:32:36.987
Well, do you think
you could be so kind


633
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.572
as to go inside and see

634
00:32:38.655 --> 00:32:40.073
if Mother is ready
to head out?


635
00:32:40.157 --> 00:32:41.325
All right. Hey.

636
00:32:41.408 --> 00:32:42.701
- Mother!
- Don't yell, man.


637
00:32:42.785 --> 00:32:43.786
Be civilized.

638
00:32:43.869 --> 00:32:45.871
You're just like our dad, man.

639
00:32:45.954 --> 00:32:48.207
So you do right by me, Monk.
I swear to fucking God.


640
00:32:49.541 --> 00:32:51.168
Clown.

641
00:32:51.251 --> 00:32:52.336
You want
to see civilized?


642
00:32:52.419 --> 00:32:54.004
-  Mother!

643
00:32:58.175 --> 00:32:59.176
Morning.

644
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.554
Hey. Morning.

645
00:33:03.639 --> 00:33:05.224
Listen...

646
00:33:05.307 --> 00:33:07.100
- about last night, uh--
- Oh.


647
00:33:07.184 --> 00:33:08.393
It's okay.

648
00:33:08.602 --> 00:33:10.687
You don't have to explain.
I had a good time.


649
00:33:10.771 --> 00:33:11.814
No, I...

650
00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:16.068
Jelani, he's my ex.

651
00:33:16.151 --> 00:33:17.277
Well, he's going to be.

652
00:33:18.695 --> 00:33:20.697
We're in the middle
of breaking up and...


653
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.741
it's hard.

654
00:33:24.284 --> 00:33:25.285
I get it.

655
00:33:26.578 --> 00:33:27.579
I'd like to see you again.

656
00:33:29.081 --> 00:33:30.874
Do you think that you'll be

657
00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:31.959
around town
next couple of days?


658
00:33:32.042 --> 00:33:34.628
You know, grab a drink?

659
00:33:36.088 --> 00:33:37.089
Yeah, I'd like that.

660
00:33:39.383 --> 00:33:40.384
Yeah, me too.

661
00:33:42.719 --> 00:33:43.720
Drive safe.

662
00:33:44.847 --> 00:33:45.848
Thanks.

663
00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:12.082
Mr. Ellison?

664
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.251
We're ready.

665
00:34:18.505 --> 00:34:19.840
<i>Her MRI shows</i>

666
00:34:19.923 --> 00:34:22.342
early signs
of neurodegeneration.


667
00:34:23.135 --> 00:34:24.386
There's a slight decrease

668
00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:26.221
in the size
of the temporal lobe


669
00:34:26.305 --> 00:34:27.806
which suggest Alzheimer's.

670
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.810
I'm very sorry, Mr. Ellison.

671
00:34:31.894 --> 00:34:33.228
But at some point,

672
00:34:33.312 --> 00:34:35.647
she'll probably require
around-the-clock care


673
00:34:36.523 --> 00:34:38.191
for her own safety.

674
00:35:44.132 --> 00:35:45.842
- Hey, young nigga.
- Hey!


675
00:35:45.926 --> 00:35:48.220
Hey, whoa, whoa.

676
00:35:48.303 --> 00:35:49.972
Don't shoot me, partner.
Come on now.


677
00:35:54.643 --> 00:35:55.644
Van Go.

678
00:35:56.478 --> 00:35:57.604
That you?

679
00:35:57.688 --> 00:35:58.689
Yeah, me, nigga.

680
00:36:00.023 --> 00:36:02.025
Shit. What, you drunk, motherfucker?

681
00:36:03.402 --> 00:36:04.736
Where you running to?

682
00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:07.823
Just leave me alone, man.

683
00:36:11.076 --> 00:36:12.077
How your mama?

684
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.579
What you say?

685
00:36:14.663 --> 00:36:16.581
I said, how your mama?

686
00:36:19.751 --> 00:36:21.169
Oh, shit.

687
00:36:22.129 --> 00:36:23.380
They ain't tell you, huh?

688
00:36:24.256 --> 00:36:25.382
What you talking about, punk?

689
00:36:25.465 --> 00:36:27.300
Hey, what you talking about?

690
00:36:29.511 --> 00:36:30.804
Think about it, Van Go.

691
00:36:32.097 --> 00:36:33.223
Look at my face.

692
00:36:35.058 --> 00:36:37.352
Look at my midnight
black complex...


693
00:36:37.436 --> 00:36:38.812
No, that's not right.

694
00:36:40.355 --> 00:36:41.356
What did you want to say?

695
00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:44.901
You can say it
better than that, right?


696
00:36:44.985 --> 00:36:45.986
Come on. What do you want?

697
00:36:50.574 --> 00:36:51.742
Think about it, Van Go.

698
00:36:53.035 --> 00:36:54.286
Look at my face.

699
00:36:55.245 --> 00:36:57.706
Look at my coal black skin.

700
00:36:57.789 --> 00:36:58.957
And then look at your own.

701
00:37:01.251 --> 00:37:03.378
Look at my black eyes.

702
00:37:03.462 --> 00:37:04.463
Now look at your own.

703
00:37:06.214 --> 00:37:08.008
Look at my big black lips.

704
00:37:08.091 --> 00:37:09.885
Now look at your own.

705
00:37:11.303 --> 00:37:12.929
I's your daddy
whether you like it or not.


706
00:37:13.013 --> 00:37:15.474
Shut up, okay?
Shut up, man! You lying!


707
00:37:15.557 --> 00:37:17.350
No, no,
that's the truth, nigga.


708
00:37:19.102 --> 00:37:20.645
So, where you been, huh?

709
00:37:21.354 --> 00:37:22.481
Where you been?

710
00:37:22.564 --> 00:37:24.149
I've been where I always be.

711
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:26.276
Surviving.

712
00:37:27.235 --> 00:37:29.196
You ain't worth a piss.

713
00:37:29.279 --> 00:37:30.781
Your mama ain't worth a piss.

714
00:37:30.864 --> 00:37:32.532
So here I am.

715
00:37:41.374 --> 00:37:43.376
What do I say now?

716
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.797
I think now will come
some sort of, you know,


717
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.673
dumb, melodramatic
sob story


718
00:37:48.757 --> 00:37:51.009
where you, uh, highlight
your broken interiority.


719
00:37:51.093 --> 00:37:53.386
Something... something
like, um, I don't know...


720
00:37:58.683 --> 00:38:00.060
I hates this man.

721
00:38:01.686 --> 00:38:02.896
I hates my mama.

722
00:38:02.979 --> 00:38:04.189
And I hates myself.

723
00:38:07.734 --> 00:38:09.402
I've seen my face in his.

724
00:38:11.029 --> 00:38:12.531
I see the ape
that all them stupid girls


725
00:38:12.614 --> 00:38:14.699
were afraid of, yeah.

726
00:38:14.783 --> 00:38:16.618
I can see my long arms
hanging down.


727
00:38:17.536 --> 00:38:19.162
And I see eyes that don't care

728
00:38:19.246 --> 00:38:20.831
what happens tomorrow.

729
00:38:25.043 --> 00:38:26.169
I see myself

730
00:38:27.003 --> 00:38:28.130
rocking back on my heels,

731
00:38:28.213 --> 00:38:29.214
just like this, baby.

732
00:38:29.923 --> 00:38:31.383
Just waiting.

733
00:38:31.466 --> 00:38:33.510
And waiting, and waiting,
and waiting,


734
00:38:33.593 --> 00:38:35.053
and waiting for something

735
00:38:35.137 --> 00:38:37.305
that I'm not even going
to recognize when it comes!


736
00:38:38.056 --> 00:38:39.933
Death is my only cure.

737
00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:42.102
I heard that before.

738
00:38:44.104 --> 00:38:46.148
I've been hearing it,
and I'm hearing it now.


739
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:50.110
I see...

740
00:38:53.155 --> 00:38:54.614
I see my mama crying.

741
00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:58.618
I see her screaming
in my dreams.


742
00:38:58.702 --> 00:38:59.953
I see my babies.

743
00:39:00.787 --> 00:39:01.788
I see my...

744
00:39:02.455 --> 00:39:03.498
I see my daddy.

745
00:39:06.084 --> 00:39:07.294
I see myself.

746
00:39:09.754 --> 00:39:10.839
What the fuck?

747
00:39:14.134 --> 00:39:15.468
What the fuck you do that for?

748
00:39:15.552 --> 00:39:16.845
Because you ain't shit, nigga.

749
00:39:19.806 --> 00:39:20.932
And you made me.

750
00:39:23.226 --> 00:39:25.896
So because you ain't shit,
I ain't shit.


751
00:39:27.606 --> 00:39:30.192
Because you ain't shit,
I ain't shit.


752
00:39:37.324 --> 00:39:38.575
I gots to bounce.

753
00:39:43.622 --> 00:39:44.789
Peace, motherfucker.

754
00:39:46.124 --> 00:39:47.125
Peace.

755
00:39:50.212 --> 00:39:51.588
What the fuck was that for?

756
00:39:56.718 --> 00:39:57.761
<i>You're watching</i>

757
00:39:57.844 --> 00:40:01.264
<i>Black Stories Month on WHN.</i>

758
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.101
<i>Celebrating the diversity</i>

759
00:40:05.185 --> 00:40:06.519
<i>of the African-American

00:40:07.854 --> 00:40:09.814
<i>Join us for more

761
00:40:09.898 --> 00:40:12.192
<i>- heartbreak, and drama.</i>

762
00:40:12.275 --> 00:40:13.401
-  <i>Mama!</i>

763
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.821
Hello?

764
00:40:16.905 --> 00:40:19.282
"I be standing outside
in the night,


765
00:40:19.366 --> 00:40:20.909
a police chopper go by

766
00:40:20.992 --> 00:40:22.827
and shine some lights
in some backyards


767
00:40:22.911 --> 00:40:26.623
and I think, 'Shine that
light on me, motherfucker,


768
00:40:26.706 --> 00:40:28.375
<i>shine me some fucking light</i>

769
00:40:28.458 --> 00:40:30.877
so I can see
where the fuck I be at.'"


770
00:40:31.795 --> 00:40:32.963
<i>Are you serious?</i>

771
00:40:33.046 --> 00:40:34.297
You notice I didn't put
my name on it.


772
00:40:34.381 --> 00:40:35.799
<i>Yes, Stagg R. Leigh,</i>

773
00:40:35.882 --> 00:40:37.717
I did notice that. Well done.

774
00:40:37.801 --> 00:40:39.177
But I still can't
send this out.


775
00:40:39.261 --> 00:40:40.470
You said you wanted
Black stuff.


776
00:40:40.553 --> 00:40:41.888
What's Blacker than that?

777
00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.765
It's got deadbeat dads,

778
00:40:43.848 --> 00:40:44.933
rappers, crack,

779
00:40:45.141 --> 00:40:46.977
and he gets killed
by a cop in the end.


780
00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.230
I mean, that's... that's...
that's Black, right?


781
00:40:51.523 --> 00:40:52.649
I see what you're doing.

782
00:40:52.857 --> 00:40:54.484
<i>Good,
because it's not subtle.</i>


783
00:40:54.567 --> 00:40:55.902
I mean, how's that book
so different


784
00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:57.195
than some of the other garbage
they put out?


785
00:40:57.279 --> 00:40:58.113
That's not the point.

786
00:40:58.196 --> 00:40:59.447
Well, it's my point.

787
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:01.449
Look at what they publish.

788
00:41:01.533 --> 00:41:02.617
Look at what
they expect us to write.


789
00:41:03.368 --> 00:41:04.703
I'm sick of it.

790
00:41:04.786 --> 00:41:07.998
And that's an expression
of how sick I am.


791
00:41:08.081 --> 00:41:09.666
<i>Monk,
I'm trying to sell books,</i>


792
00:41:09.749 --> 00:41:11.167
<i>not be a part of some crusade.</i>

793
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.753
Who do you expect
to publish this?


794
00:41:13.837 --> 00:41:15.505
No one.

795
00:41:15.588 --> 00:41:17.966
I just want to rub their noses
in the horseshit they solicit.


796
00:41:19.301 --> 00:41:20.343
Okay.

797
00:41:20.427 --> 00:41:21.594
What do you want me to do?

798
00:41:21.678 --> 00:41:22.929
<i>I want you
to send it out.</i>


799
00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.431
Can I say
it's performance art?


800
00:41:24.514 --> 00:41:26.808
No. Send it straight.

801
00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:29.102
If they can't take the joke,
then fuck them.


802
00:41:30.854 --> 00:41:32.188
All right,
but I'm only sending it


803
00:41:32.272 --> 00:41:33.982
to a couple of places.
This thing scares me.


804
00:41:34.065 --> 00:41:35.525
<i>Scares you? Why?</i>

805
00:41:35.608 --> 00:41:36.901
Because white people think

806
00:41:36.985 --> 00:41:38.820
they want the truth,
but they don't.


807
00:41:38.903 --> 00:41:41.072
They just want
to feel absolved.


808
00:41:41.156 --> 00:41:43.742
Well, fortunately,
that's not my problem.


809
00:41:44.743 --> 00:41:46.202
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Bye.


810
00:42:07.724 --> 00:42:08.892
I'm surprised you reached out.

811
00:42:08.975 --> 00:42:11.019
I thought you were
just being nice.


812
00:42:11.102 --> 00:42:14.147
Oh, I'm never just being nice.
I'm too old for that.


813
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.982
You know, I like you
so much, in fact,


814
00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:17.817
that I went out and got
another one of your books.


815
00:42:18.902 --> 00:42:20.362
Really? Which one?

816
00:42:20.445 --> 00:42:21.446
<i>The Haas Conundrum.</i>

817
00:42:22.697 --> 00:42:23.698
What'd you think?

818
00:42:24.616 --> 00:42:25.742
I liked it.

819
00:42:26.743 --> 00:42:29.496
Susan has
really great dialogue.


820
00:42:29.579 --> 00:42:32.040
And I love the aunt.

821
00:42:32.123 --> 00:42:34.042
Wow. I mean,
you write women well.


822
00:42:34.876 --> 00:42:36.211
Oh, you think so?

823
00:42:36.294 --> 00:42:37.629
Yeah. They're not
hothouse flowers.


824
00:42:37.712 --> 00:42:38.713
Thank you.

825
00:42:40.423 --> 00:42:42.801
- I appreciate that.
-  Mm.


826
00:42:42.884 --> 00:42:44.844
I could've done
with less footnotes though.


827
00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:53.770
I, uh...

828
00:42:53.853 --> 00:42:54.938
I got to run.

829
00:42:57.148 --> 00:42:58.483
Well, how's your mom?

830
00:42:59.567 --> 00:43:01.569
In and out.

831
00:43:01.653 --> 00:43:03.405
I'm afraid to be away
for too long.


832
00:43:04.781 --> 00:43:05.865
- Yeah.
- But, uh...


833
00:43:08.284 --> 00:43:09.327
I'll, uh...

834
00:43:11.246 --> 00:43:12.330
I'll call you.

835
00:43:14.416 --> 00:43:15.417
Hold on a minute.

836
00:43:21.756 --> 00:43:22.674
Sign my book.

837
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:34.811
What's your name again?

838
00:43:35.812 --> 00:43:36.813
Hm.

839
00:44:21.316 --> 00:44:22.317
Mr. Monk?

840
00:44:27.238 --> 00:44:28.615
What's going on
with the lights?


841
00:44:29.532 --> 00:44:31.493
Miss Lisa used
to pay the bill.


842
00:44:32.619 --> 00:44:33.620
Did you?

843
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:39.918
How much?

844
00:44:40.001 --> 00:44:41.211
<i>Well, I can handle</i>

845
00:44:41.294 --> 00:44:42.670
the electrical bills,

846
00:44:42.754 --> 00:44:44.380
but these care facilities
are expensive.


847
00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.799
<i>The best one nearby</i>

848
00:44:46.883 --> 00:44:51.471
is $5,600 a month,
and that's for a shared room.


849
00:44:51.554 --> 00:44:54.516
It goes up to $6,900 a month
for a private room.


850
00:44:54.599 --> 00:44:55.808
Well, why you looking
at the best one?


851
00:44:55.892 --> 00:44:57.310
She wasn't the best mother.

852
00:44:57.393 --> 00:44:59.062
Look, I'm not here
to re-litigate our childhoods.


853
00:44:59.145 --> 00:45:01.022
Of course not,
because yours was great.


854
00:45:01.105 --> 00:45:03.942
<i>Goddamn it!
Are you going
to help me or not?</i>


855
00:45:04.025 --> 00:45:05.944
Won't Medicaid cover it
or something?


856
00:45:06.027 --> 00:45:08.071
That's not how it works.
You don't know this?


857
00:45:08.154 --> 00:45:09.614
Oh. Hello.

858
00:45:12.325 --> 00:45:14.160
<i>Who's that?
What are you doing?</i>


859
00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:15.870
- I've taken a lover.

860
00:45:15.954 --> 00:45:17.080
You've taken a lover?

861
00:45:17.288 --> 00:45:18.748
You got a problem
with that, homophobe?


862
00:45:18.998 --> 00:45:21.251
Listen, I'm not offended that
you've taken a lover, Cliff.


863
00:45:21.834 --> 00:45:22.835
I'm offended, Cliff,

864
00:45:22.919 --> 00:45:25.129
that you call it
taking a lover.


865
00:45:25.213 --> 00:45:27.090
Mm, you can eat shit, nigga.

866
00:45:27.173 --> 00:45:29.509
- I'll take my lover right now.

867
00:45:29.592 --> 00:45:30.969
Hey, where you going?

868
00:45:49.445 --> 00:45:50.446
There you are.

869
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:52.282
Traffic was insane. What's up?

870
00:45:52.907 --> 00:45:53.908
Sit down.

871
00:45:58.621 --> 00:45:59.622
Have a seat.

872
00:46:04.627 --> 00:46:05.628
We sold your book.

873
00:46:08.506 --> 00:46:10.592
Holy shit!

874
00:46:10.675 --> 00:46:13.052
- I thought it was DOA.
- Not <i>The Persians.</i>


875
00:46:16.347 --> 00:46:17.223
No.

876
00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:19.851
- Get out!

877
00:46:19.934 --> 00:46:21.853
Paula Betaman
from Thompson-Watt.


878
00:46:21.936 --> 00:46:23.271
She always passes.

879
00:46:23.354 --> 00:46:27.984
Not this time. They want
to preempt for $750,000.


880
00:46:28.067 --> 00:46:30.445
No one's ever offered
that much to me.


881
00:46:30.528 --> 00:46:32.614
- This is you.
- No, it's not, Arthur.


882
00:46:32.697 --> 00:46:34.365
-  You wrote it.
- As a joke.


883
00:46:34.449 --> 00:46:36.242
Well, now it's the most
lucrative joke


884
00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:37.410
you've ever told.

885
00:46:37.619 --> 00:46:39.162
-  And I'm not selling.
- Why not?


886
00:46:39.245 --> 00:46:41.456
Because it's trash, Arthur.

887
00:46:41.539 --> 00:46:44.125
You didn't even want
to send it out the other day.


888
00:46:44.208 --> 00:46:47.837
Oh, but look who's suddenly
overcome his fears.


889
00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.048
I know, I broke
the first rule of sales.


890
00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:52.342
Never underestimate
how stupid everyone is.


891
00:46:52.425 --> 00:46:56.054
Well, I'm not participating
in making them any stupider.


892
00:46:56.137 --> 00:46:57.805
Well, you haven't thus far,

893
00:46:57.889 --> 00:47:00.642
which is admirable, but...

894
00:47:01.643 --> 00:47:03.144
you also haven't
made any money.


895
00:47:06.564 --> 00:47:08.441
Doesn't your mom
need help these days?


896
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:12.528
Check this out.

897
00:47:16.616 --> 00:47:18.868
I don't care how drunk we get,
I'm not selling it.


898
00:47:18.951 --> 00:47:20.244
That's not
what I'm doing.


899
00:47:22.789 --> 00:47:25.458
Johnnie Walker Red, 24 bucks.

900
00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:27.794
Johnnie Walker Black,

901
00:47:28.628 --> 00:47:30.129
Johnnie Walker Blue...

902
00:47:31.255 --> 00:47:33.257
$160.

903
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:34.342
You see the metaphor?

904
00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.969
No.

905
00:47:37.053 --> 00:47:39.472
These are all made
by the same company.


906
00:47:39.555 --> 00:47:42.016
The Red is shit,
the Black is less shit,


907
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.768
the Blue is good.

908
00:47:43.851 --> 00:47:46.604
But fewer people buy the blue
because it's expensive.


909
00:47:46.688 --> 00:47:47.814
And at the end of the day,

910
00:47:47.897 --> 00:47:49.065
most people
just want to get drunk.


911
00:47:51.025 --> 00:47:53.194
For most of your career,
your books have been Blue.


912
00:47:53.903 --> 00:47:56.072
They're good, complex.

913
00:47:56.823 --> 00:47:58.074
But they're not popular

914
00:47:58.157 --> 00:48:01.411
because most people
want something easy.


915
00:48:01.494 --> 00:48:05.707
Now, for the first time ever,
you've written a Red book.


916
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:07.083
It's simple, prurient.

917
00:48:07.166 --> 00:48:08.668
It's not great
literature, but...


918
00:48:10.211 --> 00:48:11.504
satisfies an urge.

919
00:48:13.339 --> 00:48:15.258
And that's valuable.

920
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:17.301
What I'm trying
to illustrate is that,


921
00:48:17.385 --> 00:48:19.429
just because you do Red

922
00:48:19.512 --> 00:48:22.306
doesn't mean
you can't also do Blue.


923
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:23.391
You can do it all.

924
00:48:24.392 --> 00:48:25.852
Like Johnnie Walker.

925
00:48:25.935 --> 00:48:28.521
In fact, you got Johnnie
Walker beat, because...


926
00:48:28.604 --> 00:48:30.398
you don't even have
to put your real name on it.


927
00:48:37.572 --> 00:48:38.823
Jesus.

928
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.784
Do we drink now?

929
00:48:47.039 --> 00:48:47.915
<i>Hello?</i>

930
00:48:47.999 --> 00:48:49.208
Hello, Paula.

931
00:48:49.292 --> 00:48:52.044
Arthur! So wonderful
to hear from you.


932
00:48:52.128 --> 00:48:55.715
Um, I hope that you are
with the man of the hour.


933
00:48:55.798 --> 00:48:57.967
I am, indeed.
He's right here next to me.


934
00:48:58.050 --> 00:48:59.677
Mr. Leigh?

935
00:48:59.761 --> 00:49:01.012
<i>Uh, yeah, this is he.</i>

936
00:49:02.138 --> 00:49:03.139
Oh, really?

937
00:49:11.105 --> 00:49:12.106
Uh...

938
00:49:12.565 --> 00:49:14.901
Yeah, goddamn it.

939
00:49:14.984 --> 00:49:17.236
- Right. Right. Okay.
-  <i>Motherfucker.</i>


940
00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.198
Yeah, I was a little confused
at first, but...


941
00:49:20.281 --> 00:49:23.159
We're both very excited to
discuss Thompson-Watt's offer.


942
00:49:23.242 --> 00:49:24.619
Yes, well, first of all,
let me just say


943
00:49:24.702 --> 00:49:26.037
that all of us here
at Thompson-Watt


944
00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.623
are thrilled with <i>My Pafology.</i>

945
00:49:28.706 --> 00:49:30.792
It is about as perfect a book

946
00:49:30.875 --> 00:49:32.877
as I have seen
in a long, long while.


947
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.964
<i>Just... just raw and real.</i>

948
00:49:37.048 --> 00:49:40.343
And, Mr. Leigh,
is this based
on your actual life?


949
00:49:42.428 --> 00:49:44.764
Yeah, you think some
bitch-ass college boy


950
00:49:44.847 --> 00:49:46.057
can come up with that shit?

951
00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.141
No, no. No, I don't.

952
00:49:48.017 --> 00:49:50.228
No. You know, that kind of

953
00:49:50.311 --> 00:49:54.148
visceral energy
cannot be taught, right?


954
00:49:54.232 --> 00:49:57.068
Stagg... May I call you--
Now, is Stagg a pseudonym?


955
00:49:58.528 --> 00:50:00.822
Yes, uh, it is.

956
00:50:00.905 --> 00:50:03.032
Mr. Leigh can't use
his real name


957
00:50:03.115 --> 00:50:05.076
because he's a...

958
00:50:06.077 --> 00:50:08.120
Well, he's a wanted fugitive.

959
00:50:08.204 --> 00:50:10.373
<i>Oh, my God. Wow.</i>

960
00:50:10.456 --> 00:50:12.959
That's why this couldn't
be a video conference.


961
00:50:13.042 --> 00:50:15.169
Are you crazy?
What if they fact check this?


962
00:50:15.253 --> 00:50:17.296
I checked. There's barely
money to pay editors anymore.


963
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:19.257
Just go with it.

964
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:26.889
Yeah, I did a 12-year bid,
but no going back.


965
00:50:28.099 --> 00:50:29.308
Know what I mean?

966
00:50:29.392 --> 00:50:31.561
Yeah. Yeah, you know, um...

967
00:50:32.395 --> 00:50:34.105
I've been reading a lot

968
00:50:34.188 --> 00:50:36.107
about the prison abolition
movement...


969
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:37.650
- Oh, God!
-  <i>I've...</i>


970
00:50:37.733 --> 00:50:39.735
Sorry to rush, Paula,
but can we talk business?


971
00:50:39.819 --> 00:50:42.238
Mr. Leigh values
his time outside of a cell.


972
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:43.447
<i>Of course.</i>

973
00:50:43.531 --> 00:50:44.907
I'm sure you're both
very, very busy


974
00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:46.534
so I will get right to it.

975
00:50:46.617 --> 00:50:49.036
Um, you'll notice
that our offer is...


976
00:50:50.371 --> 00:50:51.789
unusually large

977
00:50:51.873 --> 00:50:54.834
<i>and that is because we believe</i>

978
00:50:54.917 --> 00:50:57.211
Mr. Leigh has
written a bestseller.


979
00:50:57.295 --> 00:50:59.422
We think it is going to be
the read of the summer.


980
00:51:00.089 --> 00:51:01.799
Yeah, I'm sure

981
00:51:01.883 --> 00:51:05.720
white people on the Hamptons
will delight in it.


982
00:51:05.803 --> 00:51:07.054
<i>Yes, we will.</i>

983
00:51:07.138 --> 00:51:10.558
They-- We-- It's going
to be huge. Huge.


984
00:51:11.434 --> 00:51:12.435
<i>I love it.</i>

985
00:51:21.819 --> 00:51:23.905
Is that little
Thelonious Ellison?


986
00:51:26.532 --> 00:51:27.909
My God! Maynard!

987
00:51:30.828 --> 00:51:33.039
Everyone still call you Monk?

988
00:51:33.122 --> 00:51:34.165
Well,

989
00:51:34.248 --> 00:51:35.583
everyone but you.

990
00:51:35.666 --> 00:51:38.085
Well,
it's a beautiful name.


991
00:51:38.169 --> 00:51:41.088
It seems simple
not to use it whole.


992
00:51:41.172 --> 00:51:43.132
Well, I'm glad someone
appreciates it.


993
00:51:44.675 --> 00:51:47.762
I heard about your sister.
My condolences.


994
00:51:47.845 --> 00:51:48.846
Thank you.

995
00:51:50.014 --> 00:51:51.515
I don't think
I've seen you since


996
00:51:52.475 --> 00:51:53.976
before your father passed?

997
00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.228
Yeah, it's been a while.
I live in LA now.


998
00:51:56.979 --> 00:51:58.522
Oh! Hollywood.

999
00:51:58.606 --> 00:52:00.775
Hey, do you write
for that <i>NCIS?</i>


1000
00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:03.235
Just books.

1001
00:52:03.319 --> 00:52:06.447
Well, you should try to write
for <i>NCIS.</i> It's popular.


1002
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:08.491
- Well, maybe I will.

1003
00:52:08.574 --> 00:52:10.493
Hey, so, how you been?

1004
00:52:10.576 --> 00:52:12.286
Oh, I'm good. And you?

1005
00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:13.454
- Yeah...
- Mr. Monk.


1006
00:52:13.537 --> 00:52:15.122
What would you like
for dinner?


1007
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.085
Maynard!

1008
00:52:19.168 --> 00:52:20.211
Hi, Lorraine.

1009
00:52:21.003 --> 00:52:22.588
It's been a dog's age.

1010
00:52:23.422 --> 00:52:24.799
Well, I guess it has.

1011
00:52:27.093 --> 00:52:28.260
You look well.

1012
00:52:29.595 --> 00:52:30.972
You too.

1013
00:52:34.058 --> 00:52:35.685
Well, I best be getting back.

1014
00:52:35.768 --> 00:52:37.436
It's good to see you,
Thelonious.


1015
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.521
You too.

1016
00:52:41.148 --> 00:52:42.149
Lorraine.

1017
00:52:45.861 --> 00:52:47.029
Mm, mm, mm.

1018
00:52:56.747 --> 00:52:57.873
Ain't nothing to smile at.

1019
00:53:00.501 --> 00:53:03.004
-  Oh! There she is.

1020
00:53:03.087 --> 00:53:04.296
Behave yourself.

1021
00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.597
Hey. Hi.

1022
00:53:15.391 --> 00:53:17.560
- Got this for you.
-  Oh, thank you.


1023
00:53:17.643 --> 00:53:20.062
- Lorraine, this is Coraline.
- Oh.


1024
00:53:20.146 --> 00:53:21.439
- Hey.
- Welcome.


1025
00:53:21.522 --> 00:53:22.565
- Yeah, hello.
- Hello.


1026
00:53:22.648 --> 00:53:23.691
Mother, perfect timing.

1027
00:53:23.774 --> 00:53:25.234
This is Coraline.

1028
00:53:25.317 --> 00:53:27.528
Hello, dear, I'm Agnes.

1029
00:53:27.611 --> 00:53:29.697
Such a pleasure to meet you.
I brought you these.


1030
00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.616
Dahlias
are my favorite.


1031
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.285
There's a whole world
inside them.


1032
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:41.917
- Lorraine?
-  Yes.


1033
00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:46.172
Mother, you sit here.

1034
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.550
All right.

1035
00:53:49.633 --> 00:53:52.386
And, Coraline, why don't you
sit across from Mother?


1036
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:53.596
Oh, sure, sure.

1037
00:54:00.061 --> 00:54:01.520
Okay.

1038
00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:05.357
I'm happy you're not white.

1039
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.401
Me too.

1040
00:54:20.289 --> 00:54:21.791
Yeah,
it was pretty funny.


1041
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.376
Well, I think you...

1042
00:54:25.544 --> 00:54:27.630
I think you remind her
of my sister.


1043
00:54:28.506 --> 00:54:29.507
Mm.

1044
00:54:30.883 --> 00:54:34.345
Well, do you think
we look alike?


1045
00:54:35.262 --> 00:54:36.347
No, but...

1046
00:54:37.556 --> 00:54:39.266
you're both self-assured...

1047
00:54:40.476 --> 00:54:41.727
and funny...

1048
00:54:43.062 --> 00:54:45.439
and you're both...

1049
00:54:46.565 --> 00:54:48.776
fantastic kissers.

1050
00:54:48.859 --> 00:54:51.320
- Oh. Ooh.

1051
00:55:00.538 --> 00:55:01.914
Mrs. Ellison?

1052
00:55:04.416 --> 00:55:05.876
Mrs. Ellison?

1053
00:55:08.254 --> 00:55:09.547
Mr. Monk!

1054
00:55:13.008 --> 00:55:15.803
Mr. Monk!

1055
00:55:15.886 --> 00:55:17.221
- I just... I just...
- What's wrong?


1056
00:55:17.304 --> 00:55:18.931
I just stepped outside
for a moment.


1057
00:55:19.014 --> 00:55:20.182
What's wrong?

1058
00:55:20.266 --> 00:55:21.392
Having a cup of coffee
with Maynard,


1059
00:55:21.475 --> 00:55:22.893
I was right in front.

1060
00:55:22.977 --> 00:55:23.853
Where's Mother?

1061
00:55:23.936 --> 00:55:25.104
- I don't know!
- What?


1062
00:55:25.187 --> 00:55:26.564
The backdoor was open.

1063
00:55:26.647 --> 00:55:28.232
- She gone.
- What?


1064
00:55:28.315 --> 00:55:29.859
We should split up. Here.

1065
00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.361
I got more in the car.

1066
00:55:35.447 --> 00:55:36.448
Mother!

1067
00:55:37.658 --> 00:55:38.659
Mother!

1068
00:55:39.952 --> 00:55:40.953
Mother!

1069
00:55:42.163 --> 00:55:43.164
Mother!

1070
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:48.711
Mother!

1071
00:55:50.921 --> 00:55:51.922
Mother.

1072
00:55:53.674 --> 00:55:55.384
Mother!

1073
00:55:57.428 --> 00:55:58.888
Mother! Hey!

1074
00:56:00.347 --> 00:56:01.807
Mother! Mother!

1075
00:56:02.474 --> 00:56:04.143
Hey! Hey, stop!

1076
00:56:04.226 --> 00:56:05.895
Hey! Where are you going?

1077
00:56:05.978 --> 00:56:07.646
Lisa's out there

1078
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:09.565
roughhousing with the cousins.
Somebody's going to get hurt.


1079
00:56:10.357 --> 00:56:12.026
Stop. Um...

1080
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:15.404
I will go tell her. Okay?

1081
00:56:15.487 --> 00:56:17.656
- Yeah, but then--
- I'll take you back
to the house


1082
00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:18.782
and then I will go tell her.

1083
00:56:18.866 --> 00:56:19.909
But they're out there.

1084
00:56:19.992 --> 00:56:21.452
I know, I know.

1085
00:56:21.535 --> 00:56:23.454
- Okay, you sure?
- I will tell her.


1086
00:56:23.537 --> 00:56:24.914
- Okay.
- Now, come on.


1087
00:56:24.997 --> 00:56:26.165
It's too cold out here.

1088
00:56:26.248 --> 00:56:27.833
-  You should...
-  Okay.


1089
00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:29.543
Lisa doesn't swim
very well.


1090
00:56:29.627 --> 00:56:31.128
I know. I know.

1091
00:56:31.879 --> 00:56:33.631
Okay. Almost there.

1092
00:56:34.632 --> 00:56:35.633
All right.

1093
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:37.551
Oh, good.

1094
00:56:38.302 --> 00:56:39.845
- Good.
- Here we go.


1095
00:56:41.722 --> 00:56:42.723
All right.

1096
00:56:43.474 --> 00:56:44.808
Okay, Monkie.

1097
00:56:44.892 --> 00:56:45.935
All right.

1098
00:56:52.566 --> 00:56:55.110
And this is our library.

1099
00:56:55.194 --> 00:56:57.988
It's full of all the classics.
And we try to get some


1100
00:56:58.072 --> 00:56:59.073
new releases too.

1101
00:57:02.326 --> 00:57:04.161
Do you like to read,
Mrs. Ellison?


1102
00:57:04.245 --> 00:57:05.246
No.

1103
00:57:05.663 --> 00:57:07.206
That's not true.

1104
00:57:07.289 --> 00:57:09.250
She loves to read.
She taught me to love reading.


1105
00:57:10.084 --> 00:57:11.085
Perhaps we can get

1106
00:57:11.168 --> 00:57:12.336
some of your son's books
in here.


1107
00:57:12.419 --> 00:57:13.671
And you can lead a book club.

1108
00:57:13.754 --> 00:57:14.755
Hm.

1109
00:57:18.467 --> 00:57:20.052
Sorry.

1110
00:57:20.135 --> 00:57:22.221
It's fine. It's hard for a lot
of the residents at first.


1111
00:57:22.304 --> 00:57:23.722
But she'll settle in.

1112
00:57:23.806 --> 00:57:24.932
Right.

1113
00:57:26.558 --> 00:57:28.310
I appreciate all your help,

1114
00:57:28.394 --> 00:57:31.021
but how soon do you think
we can get her in?


1115
00:57:31.105 --> 00:57:32.690
Uh, in about a month.

1116
00:57:32.773 --> 00:57:34.858
You can start the paperwork
today if you'd like.


1117
00:57:34.942 --> 00:57:36.652
- Great. I'd like that.

1118
00:57:38.112 --> 00:57:39.571
I'll go check
on your mom, okay?


1119
00:57:39.655 --> 00:57:40.656
Thank you.

1120
00:57:45.244 --> 00:57:47.162
- Hello?
<i>-</i>  [Carl] <i>Hey, Thelonious.</i>


1121
00:57:47.246 --> 00:57:48.872
How you doing?
My name is Carl Brunt.


1122
00:57:49.581 --> 00:57:50.749
I am the director

1123
00:57:50.833 --> 00:57:52.418
of the New England
Book Association.


1124
00:57:52.501 --> 00:57:55.004
Hi, Carl. I know who you are.

1125
00:57:55.087 --> 00:57:57.339
<i>Oh, good.
Then perhaps you'll also know</i>


1126
00:57:57.423 --> 00:57:59.425
that each year
my organization bestows


1127
00:57:59.508 --> 00:58:03.220
the somewhat pretentiously
named Literary Award.


1128
00:58:03.304 --> 00:58:06.140
Every writer knows
the Literary Award, Carl.


1129
00:58:06.223 --> 00:58:08.100
Especially those of us
who haven't won it.


1130
00:58:08.183 --> 00:58:11.228
Yeah. Yeah.

1131
00:58:11.312 --> 00:58:13.897
Well, that's sort of related
to why I'm calling.


1132
00:58:13.981 --> 00:58:15.524
Like many
American institutions,


1133
00:58:15.607 --> 00:58:17.359
mine was recently rattled
by the notion


1134
00:58:17.443 --> 00:58:19.194
that our lack of diversity

1135
00:58:19.278 --> 00:58:21.572
had led to a blind spot
in our work.


1136
00:58:21.655 --> 00:58:24.283
So, you know, we're kind
of trying to remedy that.


1137
00:58:24.366 --> 00:58:25.409
<i>And to that end,
I was wondering</i>


1138
00:58:25.492 --> 00:58:26.869
<i>how you might feel</i>

1139
00:58:27.119 --> 00:58:28.746
<i>about being a judge
in this year's award ceremony?</i>


1140
00:58:29.997 --> 00:58:32.833
Um, let me say first,

1141
00:58:32.916 --> 00:58:35.127
<i>Carl, that I'm honored
you choose me</i>


1142
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:37.880
out of all the Black writers
you could go to out of fear


1143
00:58:37.963 --> 00:58:39.089
of being called racist.

1144
00:58:39.173 --> 00:58:41.300
Yeah, you're very welcome.

1145
00:58:41.383 --> 00:58:45.012
But I think this sounds
like a lot of work.


1146
00:58:45.095 --> 00:58:46.555
Yeah, I can't deny that.

1147
00:58:46.638 --> 00:58:48.557
I mean, you're going to have
to read dozens of books.


1148
00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.642
We could offer you
a modest stipend.


1149
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.561
Even so, I'm not sure.

1150
00:58:53.187 --> 00:58:54.355
<i>Okay.</i>

1151
00:58:54.438 --> 00:58:55.856
One of the crass perk
I reference


1152
00:58:55.939 --> 00:58:57.566
when people are kind of
on the fence like this


1153
00:58:57.649 --> 00:58:59.443
is that this will allow you
the opportunity


1154
00:58:59.526 --> 00:59:01.695
to literally judge
these other writers for once,


1155
00:59:01.779 --> 00:59:02.946
rather than just figuratively.

1156
00:59:04.573 --> 00:59:05.866
All right, I'm in.

1157
00:59:05.949 --> 00:59:07.284
<i>Well, fantastic. Okay.</i>

1158
00:59:07.493 --> 00:59:10.037
Great. So you're going
to be one of five judges.


1159
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.706
Uh, the only one
we have confirmed so far


1160
00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:14.083
is Sintara Golden.

1161
00:59:14.166 --> 00:59:15.501
Are you familiar
with Sintara Golden's work?


1162
00:59:18.379 --> 00:59:19.838
Vaguely.

1163
00:59:19.922 --> 00:59:21.298
<i>Oh, she's great.
You're going to love her, man.</i>


1164
00:59:27.679 --> 00:59:30.599
I brought you lunch,
Mr. Monk.


1165
00:59:31.809 --> 00:59:32.893
Oh, wow.

1166
00:59:36.146 --> 00:59:37.523
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1167
00:59:37.606 --> 00:59:40.192
Well,
I have a favor to ask.


1168
00:59:42.903 --> 00:59:44.321
I was wondering
if I might be able


1169
00:59:44.405 --> 00:59:45.906
to take the afternoon off.

1170
00:59:47.449 --> 00:59:49.368
Maynard just came in
from the beach.


1171
00:59:49.451 --> 00:59:51.036
And we thought
it might be nice


1172
00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.621
to visit a museum.

1173
00:59:52.704 --> 00:59:54.415
Yes, of course.

1174
00:59:54.498 --> 00:59:56.500
I'm free today,
so I can look after Mother.


1175
01:00:01.922 --> 01:00:02.923
Lorraine.

1176
01:00:03.924 --> 01:00:04.967
Hm?

1177
01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:06.051
You really like him, huh?

1178
01:00:08.762 --> 01:00:09.930
He's a fine man.

1179
01:00:19.773 --> 01:00:20.774
Yeah.

1180
01:00:22.359 --> 01:00:24.194
Page seven.
It's got like 12.


1181
01:00:25.529 --> 01:00:29.283
The guests of honor.

1182
01:00:29.366 --> 01:00:32.536
Hello, Mrs. Ellison.
Looking beautiful as ever.


1183
01:00:32.619 --> 01:00:33.912
Hello, Arthur.

1184
01:00:36.498 --> 01:00:38.250
Layne, would you
take Mrs. Ellison
to the kitchen,


1185
01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:39.877
and set her up with some tea?

1186
01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.086
Right this way, ma'am.

1187
01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.171
Mother, I won't be long.

1188
01:00:43.005 --> 01:00:44.131
Take your time.

1189
01:00:45.466 --> 01:00:46.633
- Thank you.
-  Mm-hm.


1190
01:00:47.551 --> 01:00:48.927
- Not the pods.

1191
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:51.138
The good tea, for guests.

1192
01:00:53.474 --> 01:00:55.559
What is this?
I told you to dress street.


1193
01:00:55.642 --> 01:00:58.145
- I did.
- Fucking Sesame Street.


1194
01:00:59.605 --> 01:01:01.398
What's this guy's name?

1195
01:01:01.482 --> 01:01:03.734
- Willy?
- Wiley. Wiley Valdespino.


1196
01:01:03.817 --> 01:01:06.570
He specializes
in Oscar-baity "issue" movies.


1197
01:01:06.653 --> 01:01:09.114
He did the <i>Middle Passage</i>
one last year.


1198
01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.407
Somehow
I didn't see that.


1199
01:01:10.491 --> 01:01:11.825
Of course, not.
You're not lobotomized.


1200
01:01:11.909 --> 01:01:13.285
But if he adapts your book,

1201
01:01:13.368 --> 01:01:15.037
you stand to make
a lot of money.


1202
01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.663
Why can't we just do
a phone call?


1203
01:01:16.747 --> 01:01:18.540
Well, he said if he's going
to cut a check this large,


1204
01:01:18.624 --> 01:01:20.250
then he needs
to meet in person.


1205
01:01:20.334 --> 01:01:21.335
All right.

1206
01:01:22.169 --> 01:01:24.087
What do I need to do?

1207
01:01:24.171 --> 01:01:25.214
Just make him like you.

1208
01:01:25.297 --> 01:01:26.548
When I talked to him,

1209
01:01:26.632 --> 01:01:28.300
he seemed thrilled
that you're a fugitive.


1210
01:01:28.383 --> 01:01:29.718
Just, you know, play that up.

1211
01:01:29.801 --> 01:01:31.094
But what if he recognizes me?

1212
01:01:31.178 --> 01:01:32.304
-  You?
- Yeah, the real me.


1213
01:01:32.387 --> 01:01:34.556
Monk, you're not that famous.

1214
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.058
And nobody in Hollywood reads.

1215
01:01:36.141 --> 01:01:37.851
They got their assistants
to read things,


1216
01:01:37.935 --> 01:01:39.061
and then summarize them.

1217
01:01:39.144 --> 01:01:40.812
The whole town runs
on book reports.


1218
01:01:42.397 --> 01:01:43.899
You sure you can look
after my mother?


1219
01:01:43.982 --> 01:01:45.234
She won't leave my sight.

1220
01:01:45.317 --> 01:01:46.860
You'll just be
across the street, anyway.


1221
01:01:48.111 --> 01:01:49.238
Across the street.

1222
01:01:49.321 --> 01:01:50.322
You should go. 
You'll be late.

1223
01:01:51.281 --> 01:01:52.533
He's waiting for you.

1224
01:01:54.409 --> 01:01:56.161
Well...

1225
01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:59.790
if he, uh,
wants the stereotype,


1226
01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:02.167
maybe it's better I'm late.

1227
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:29.278
Stagg, I presume?

1228
01:02:30.153 --> 01:02:31.154
That's me.

1229
01:02:31.238 --> 01:02:33.323
Hey, I'm Wiley.

1230
01:02:33.407 --> 01:02:34.408
Nice to meet you, brother.

1231
01:02:41.748 --> 01:02:43.417
Sorry about
the bougie restaurant.


1232
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.377
My assistant picked it.

1233
01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.671
We can go somewhere else
if you're uncomfortable.


1234
01:02:47.754 --> 01:02:49.172
- This is fine.
- Okay.


1235
01:02:50.882 --> 01:02:51.883
What are you drinking?

1236
01:02:54.511 --> 01:02:56.013
I'll have a Chenin Blanc.

1237
01:02:56.096 --> 01:02:57.264
All right.

1238
01:02:57.347 --> 01:02:58.348
Of your driest.

1239
01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:02.394
Well, what's funny?

1240
01:03:02.477 --> 01:03:04.271
Ah, it's just a strange order
for a guy like you.


1241
01:03:05.063 --> 01:03:06.565
Why is that?

1242
01:03:06.648 --> 01:03:08.942
Well, you don't see many
convicts drinking white wine.


1243
01:03:09.818 --> 01:03:11.987
You know many convicts?

1244
01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:13.196
You'd be surprised.

1245
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.699
I spent a month
in the joint myself.


1246
01:03:15.782 --> 01:03:17.075
It was some interstate
commerce shit.


1247
01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:18.493
It was a short stay,
but I'll tell you what,


1248
01:03:19.411 --> 01:03:21.204
that experience grounded me.

1249
01:03:21.288 --> 01:03:23.040
The people I met in there
allowed me to see


1250
01:03:23.123 --> 01:03:25.584
a whole world
of underrepresented stories


1251
01:03:25.667 --> 01:03:27.586
from underrepresented
storytellers.


1252
01:03:29.212 --> 01:03:30.672
Can I ask
what you were in for?


1253
01:03:30.756 --> 01:03:33.884
I don't like to talk
about that.


1254
01:03:35.218 --> 01:03:36.219
You feel me?

1255
01:03:36.762 --> 01:03:37.763
Was it murder?

1256
01:03:38.639 --> 01:03:40.015
You said that, not me.

1257
01:03:43.226 --> 01:03:44.478
You know,

1258
01:03:44.561 --> 01:03:46.229
I got to tell you,
before you showed up,


1259
01:03:46.313 --> 01:03:49.149
I was a little worried
you might be a phony.


1260
01:03:49.232 --> 01:03:50.692
A lot of fakes in Hollywood.

1261
01:03:50.776 --> 01:03:52.194
Well, I'm not from Hollywood.

1262
01:03:52.277 --> 01:03:53.612
Yeah, yeah, no.
That's obvious.


1263
01:03:53.695 --> 01:03:54.988
That's obvious.

1264
01:03:55.072 --> 01:03:57.240
Clearly, you're cut
from a different cloth


1265
01:03:57.324 --> 01:03:58.325
than your average...

1266
01:03:59.326 --> 01:04:00.577
screenwriter.

1267
01:04:00.661 --> 01:04:01.870
- Let me ask you...

1268
01:04:01.953 --> 01:04:03.288
I know they sent you
some of my stuff.


1269
01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:05.082
Did you have a chance
to see any of my movies?


1270
01:04:07.584 --> 01:04:09.461
Sorry,
what did you say?


1271
01:04:09.544 --> 01:04:10.545
Have you seen
any of my movies?


1272
01:04:11.254 --> 01:04:13.048
Uh, no.

1273
01:04:13.131 --> 01:04:14.257
Okay.

1274
01:04:14.341 --> 01:04:15.676
Well, look, what I like to do

1275
01:04:15.759 --> 01:04:19.513
is I like to pair genre
with real-world pathos.


1276
01:04:19.596 --> 01:04:21.139
It kind of elevates things.

1277
01:04:21.223 --> 01:04:22.391
You might be interested
in this one


1278
01:04:22.474 --> 01:04:23.558
we're about to shoot actually.

1279
01:04:24.476 --> 01:04:26.269
It's about this white couple.

1280
01:04:26.353 --> 01:04:29.064
They get married on an old
plantation in Louisiana.


1281
01:04:29.147 --> 01:04:30.816
Then all the slave ghosts
come back,


1282
01:04:30.899 --> 01:04:31.983
and they murder everyone.

1283
01:04:32.067 --> 01:04:34.027
- Dear God.
-  I know. I know.


1284
01:04:34.111 --> 01:04:35.529
- It's great, right?

1285
01:04:35.612 --> 01:04:37.197
It's called
<i>Plantation Annihilation.</i>


1286
01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.491
Ryan Reynolds is going
to get decapitated


1287
01:04:39.574 --> 01:04:41.618
with an afro pick
in the opening scene.


1288
01:04:41.702 --> 01:04:43.036
He's a friend.

1289
01:04:43.704 --> 01:04:44.705
Got to go.

1290
01:04:55.757 --> 01:04:59.219
Mother. Mother.
Mother. Mother!


1291
01:05:11.106 --> 01:05:12.941
Some ad exec
on the third floor


1292
01:05:13.024 --> 01:05:14.234
- had an aneurysm.

1293
01:05:14.317 --> 01:05:15.986
- Awful.
- I know.


1294
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:17.529
Imagine exploding your brain

1295
01:05:17.612 --> 01:05:19.448
trying to think
of a toilet paper commercial.


1296
01:05:21.616 --> 01:05:23.118
I assume Wiley
isn't interested.


1297
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:26.163
I sprinted out of there
like a complete maniac.


1298
01:05:26.246 --> 01:05:30.000
Actually, he's offering
$4 million for the rights.


1299
01:05:30.083 --> 01:05:32.294
- What?
-  Yeah, man.


1300
01:05:32.377 --> 01:05:33.712
He called you the real deal.

1301
01:05:33.795 --> 01:05:35.046
Said you took off the moment

1302
01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:36.339
- you heard police sirens.

1303
01:05:37.424 --> 01:05:39.885
The dumber I behave,
the richer I get.


1304
01:05:39.968 --> 01:05:42.345
Now you know why my parents
moved here from Puerto Rico.


1305
01:05:46.141 --> 01:05:48.226
<i>I mean,
we can't be expected to read</i>


1306
01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:51.271
<i>every novel
all the way through, right?</i>


1307
01:05:51.354 --> 01:05:53.273
No, people have worked hard
on these books.


1308
01:05:53.356 --> 01:05:54.524
And we have to respect that.

1309
01:05:54.608 --> 01:05:56.234
Well, hard work
doesn't demand respect.


1310
01:05:56.318 --> 01:05:57.444
I mean, you know,

1311
01:05:57.652 --> 01:05:58.987
people worked hard
on the Third Reich <i>.</i>


1312
01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:02.908
Yeah, well, I feel
that we owe it to them


1313
01:06:02.991 --> 01:06:04.326
to read every page.

1314
01:06:04.409 --> 01:06:05.869
That is such horseshit.

1315
01:06:05.952 --> 01:06:07.621
I mean,
most of it's going to be


1316
01:06:07.704 --> 01:06:09.998
that Knausgard
auto-fiction crap, anyhow.


1317
01:06:10.081 --> 01:06:11.208
I tell you something
right now,


1318
01:06:11.291 --> 01:06:12.751
I'm not reading 600 pages

1319
01:06:12.834 --> 01:06:14.503
about some pretentious
jackwagon


1320
01:06:14.586 --> 01:06:15.879
discovering masturbation.

1321
01:06:15.962 --> 01:06:17.380
<i>Sorry.</i>

1322
01:06:17.464 --> 01:06:19.800
Okay, look, I think
we're all experienced enough


1323
01:06:19.883 --> 01:06:21.259
to assess the general quality

1324
01:06:21.343 --> 01:06:23.136
of something within 100 pages.

1325
01:06:24.262 --> 01:06:25.639
If you want
to read beyond that,


1326
01:06:25.722 --> 01:06:26.890
that's your prerogative.

1327
01:06:26.973 --> 01:06:29.476
Well,
how do you feel, Monk?


1328
01:06:29.559 --> 01:06:32.312
Um, I agree
with Sintara, actually.


1329
01:06:32.395 --> 01:06:34.564
I think 100 pages
is sufficient.


1330
01:06:34.648 --> 01:06:36.441
You know, this is
all a crock, anyway.


1331
01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:39.069
I mean, pitting art
against other art for awards,


1332
01:06:39.152 --> 01:06:40.821
like, it's not subjective.

1333
01:06:40.904 --> 01:06:42.531
<i>It's absurd.</i>

1334
01:06:42.614 --> 01:06:44.366
Then why did you agree to be
a judge if you feel that way?


1335
01:06:44.449 --> 01:06:47.244
Well, because it's either me
or some other Brooklyn hack


1336
01:06:47.327 --> 01:06:48.453
who doesn't think
there's a world


1337
01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:50.121
beyond the Hudson River,
Ailene.


1338
01:06:50.205 --> 01:06:53.875
It's the East River
if you're in Brooklyn, Daniel.


1339
01:06:53.959 --> 01:06:54.793
<i>You know what,</i>

1340
01:06:54.876 --> 01:06:56.503
art is subjective.

1341
01:06:56.586 --> 01:06:59.214
But I think
this is an opportunity


1342
01:06:59.297 --> 01:07:03.510
to highlight books that may
otherwise be undervalued.


1343
01:07:03.593 --> 01:07:05.762
<i>Book sales are plummeting
right now.</i>


1344
01:07:05.846 --> 01:07:08.223
So, perhaps this award
can give someone


1345
01:07:08.306 --> 01:07:10.433
a real chance at a career
in this industry.


1346
01:07:12.352 --> 01:07:13.353
Hear, hear.

1347
01:07:14.646 --> 01:07:15.981
Um...

1348
01:07:16.064 --> 01:07:17.524
Where do you want this,
Mother?


1349
01:07:18.775 --> 01:07:20.151
Thought it might
look nice here


1350
01:07:20.235 --> 01:07:21.278
with this natural light.

1351
01:07:22.237 --> 01:07:23.405
I don't care.

1352
01:07:23.488 --> 01:07:25.240
I never liked
that painting, anyway.


1353
01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.535
Okay.

1354
01:07:28.618 --> 01:07:31.496
Uh, well, I'll bring
some more art


1355
01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.831
from home next week.

1356
01:07:32.914 --> 01:07:35.333
And you just tell me
the pieces you like,


1357
01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:37.335
- and I'll bring them.

1358
01:07:37.419 --> 01:07:39.629
We've got your lunch
ready for you, Mrs. Ellison.


1359
01:07:40.755 --> 01:07:43.633
Oh, it looks great.
What is it?


1360
01:07:43.717 --> 01:07:46.928
It's roasted turkey
and Havarti on 12-grain.


1361
01:07:48.263 --> 01:07:49.806
Sounds delicious.

1362
01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:52.475
Mrs. Ellison prefers
white bread.


1363
01:07:52.559 --> 01:07:53.894
And she doesn't like
the crust.


1364
01:07:54.728 --> 01:07:56.104
As much as this place costs,

1365
01:07:56.187 --> 01:07:57.898
y'all should get
the sandwiches right.


1366
01:07:57.981 --> 01:07:59.983
I'll make sure
that we take care of that


1367
01:08:00.066 --> 01:08:01.234
from now on, okay?

1368
01:08:01.318 --> 01:08:03.612
And enjoy your lunch,
Mrs. Ellison.


1369
01:08:13.997 --> 01:08:14.998
I'm getting married.

1370
01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:16.875
- Shut up.
- What?


1371
01:08:19.336 --> 01:08:22.130
I didn't say nothing earlier.
I was just so sad.


1372
01:08:22.213 --> 01:08:26.676
But Maynard
asked me yesterday.


1373
01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:30.764
- Lorraine, that's amazing.

1374
01:08:30.847 --> 01:08:32.766
- I mean, let's celebrate.
-  Mm-mm!


1375
01:08:32.849 --> 01:08:34.851
Just too much excitement.

1376
01:08:34.935 --> 01:08:36.978
I don't like being
the center of attention.


1377
01:08:37.062 --> 01:08:38.897
Well, you deserve it,
Lorraine.


1378
01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:41.232
And Maynard is a lucky man.

1379
01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:47.030
Do you think you'd be willing

1380
01:08:47.113 --> 01:08:49.032
to walk me
down the aisle, Mr. Monk?


1381
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:53.912
I'd be honored.

1382
01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:01.920
Wow. Wow.

1383
01:09:05.006 --> 01:09:06.216
<i>We are wildly excited</i>

1384
01:09:06.299 --> 01:09:07.717
<i>to help you get</i>
My Pafology <i>out.</i>


1385
01:09:07.801 --> 01:09:09.511
<i>The marketing team
has all kinds</i>


1386
01:09:09.594 --> 01:09:11.596
<i>of great ideas
to help you sell it.</i>


1387
01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.848
Great. We're excited to hear.

1388
01:09:13.932 --> 01:09:15.475
John Bosco is the head
of the department.


1389
01:09:15.558 --> 01:09:16.601
I will let him tell you more.

1390
01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:18.186
Hi, Stagg.

1391
01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:20.355
Hello.

1392
01:09:20.438 --> 01:09:22.273
Nice to finally meet you,
my man.


1393
01:09:22.983 --> 01:09:25.110
Listen, I love the book.

1394
01:09:25.193 --> 01:09:28.363
And we are going
to sell many, many copies.


1395
01:09:28.446 --> 01:09:30.699
There's already so much buzz
because of the movie deal.


1396
01:09:30.782 --> 01:09:33.034
And we just want to keep
that momentum going.


1397
01:09:33.118 --> 01:09:34.869
I spoke to Wiley yesterday.

1398
01:09:34.953 --> 01:09:36.830
He says Michael B. Jordan
is circling.


1399
01:09:36.913 --> 01:09:38.164
<i>We heard.</i>

1400
01:09:38.248 --> 01:09:39.332
<i>We think he would
be absolutely perfect.</i>


1401
01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:40.542
<i>You know, this book,</i>

1402
01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:42.585
it's awards-bait
with a capital B.


1403
01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:44.462
And we're thinking
that if Michael does sign on,


1404
01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:45.714
we want to put him
on the cover


1405
01:09:45.797 --> 01:09:47.924
in one of those, um, scarves,

1406
01:09:48.008 --> 01:09:49.551
I guess you would call them,
tied round his head.


1407
01:09:50.468 --> 01:09:51.720
A durag?

1408
01:09:51.928 --> 01:09:54.556
<i>Durag. That's it.
Durag and a tank top</i>


1409
01:09:54.639 --> 01:09:55.890
with the muscles showing.

1410
01:09:55.974 --> 01:09:57.350
Ooh, somebody call
the fire department.


1411
01:09:57.434 --> 01:09:58.476
-  <i>Yummy.</i>

1412
01:09:59.769 --> 01:10:01.855
Shit. Sorry. Your dad. Sorry.

1413
01:10:01.938 --> 01:10:04.232
<i>So listen,
for a release date,</i>


1414
01:10:04.315 --> 01:10:05.900
we're thinking of rushing it,

1415
01:10:05.984 --> 01:10:07.235
so that we can get it out
in time


1416
01:10:07.318 --> 01:10:08.236
- for Juneteenth.
- Yeah.


1417
01:10:08.319 --> 01:10:09.821
Juneteenth?

1418
01:10:09.904 --> 01:10:12.699
<i>We're thinking of making
a big holiday push.</i>


1419
01:10:12.782 --> 01:10:14.367
Black people
will be celebrating,


1420
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:16.036
white people will be feeling,

1421
01:10:16.119 --> 01:10:18.997
let's be honest,
a little conscious-stricken.


1422
01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.124
<i>We think it's going to be
a huge moment for your book.</i>


1423
01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:23.460
- So, Stagg,

1424
01:10:23.543 --> 01:10:24.919
are you so, so happy?

1425
01:10:26.463 --> 01:10:29.924
We think it's great,
John, really. Amazing.


1426
01:10:31.301 --> 01:10:32.594
Yeah, it's, uh...

1427
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.721
It's great.

1428
01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:39.017
And, you know,
I've got an idea


1429
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.102
I want to share with you two.

1430
01:10:41.186 --> 01:10:42.520
<i>Oh, well,</i>

1431
01:10:42.604 --> 01:10:43.897
<i>I mean, we always love
to hear great ideas.</i>


1432
01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.315
-  <i>Oh, yeah, cool.</i>
-  <i>Yeah.</i>


1433
01:10:45.398 --> 01:10:46.733
I want to change the title.

1434
01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:48.777
Uh...

1435
01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.944
- I don't...
- Okay.


1436
01:10:50.028 --> 01:10:51.488
Um, well, just to be clear,

1437
01:10:51.571 --> 01:10:53.156
we really do love

1438
01:10:53.239 --> 01:10:54.574
<i>- My Pafology.</i>
- Love it.


1439
01:10:54.657 --> 01:10:56.785
It's got that whole
Irvine Welsh


1440
01:10:56.868 --> 01:10:58.995
- proletarian vernacular thing.
- Yeah.


1441
01:10:59.079 --> 01:11:00.747
No,
and that's why I think


1442
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:03.041
you're going to love
this new title even more.


1443
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.335
Well, okay, you know what,

1444
01:11:05.418 --> 01:11:08.922
we're always happy
to hear new ideas.


1445
01:11:09.005 --> 01:11:10.381
<i>What did you have in mind?</i>

1446
01:11:10.465 --> 01:11:11.466
<i>Fuck.</i>

1447
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.933
I'm sorry. Pardon me.

1448
01:11:20.016 --> 01:11:21.017
<i>Fuck.</i>

1449
01:11:22.352 --> 01:11:23.895
I want to call it <i>Fuck.</i>

1450
01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:29.109
- What are you doing?
- Screw these idiots.


1451
01:11:29.192 --> 01:11:30.360
- Stop it.
- No.


1452
01:11:32.946 --> 01:11:35.949
<i>So, Stagg, what about,
uh, like,</i> Damn?


1453
01:11:36.032 --> 01:11:38.493
-  <i>Mm-hm.</i>
-  Damn? <i>Or</i> Hell?


1454
01:11:39.494 --> 01:11:40.829
Nah. <i>Fuck.</i>

1455
01:11:40.912 --> 01:11:43.039
Okay, that's cool. Uh...

1456
01:11:43.123 --> 01:11:46.751
But maybe we could do that
with a PH instead


1457
01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:47.919
<i>because that would
be more palatable...</i>


1458
01:11:48.002 --> 01:11:49.212
- Yes. Yes.
<i>- ...to our sellers.</i>


1459
01:11:49.295 --> 01:11:51.131
I don't care about all that.

1460
01:11:51.214 --> 01:11:54.384
And if you don't change
the title, the deal is off.


1461
01:11:54.467 --> 01:11:55.927
- Oh, yeah. No.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.


1462
01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:58.888
- There's no need to be hasty.
- No, no, no.


1463
01:11:59.639 --> 01:12:00.640
You know what?

1464
01:12:01.641 --> 01:12:02.517
Why don't we--

1465
01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.643
Juts give us a second

1466
01:12:03.726 --> 01:12:06.396
and, um, a moment

1467
01:12:06.479 --> 01:12:08.314
and we will get right back
to you, okay?


1468
01:12:09.065 --> 01:12:10.316
What are you doing?

1469
01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.776
What are you doing?
This is ridiculous.


1470
01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.027
Do you know how much money
we're talking about?


1471
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:14.404
I don't care,
I'm shutting it down.


1472
01:12:14.487 --> 01:12:15.822
- Shutting it-- Come on.
- Shutting it down.


1473
01:12:15.905 --> 01:12:17.115
-  <i>Are you there?</i>
- Please, just...


1474
01:12:18.992 --> 01:12:20.410
- We're here.

1475
01:12:21.452 --> 01:12:22.453
Let's do it.

1476
01:12:23.246 --> 01:12:24.247
- What?
- What?


1477
01:12:24.747 --> 01:12:25.874
Yeah. We discussed it,

1478
01:12:25.957 --> 01:12:27.083
and we think it is very
in your face


1479
01:12:27.167 --> 01:12:28.668
in the best way possible.

1480
01:12:28.751 --> 01:12:30.336
<i>It is very, uh...</i>

1481
01:12:31.546 --> 01:12:32.797
<i>
- Uh...</i>

1482
01:12:34.048 --> 01:12:35.508
- Black?
-  <i>That's it.</i>


1483
01:12:35.592 --> 01:12:36.759
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

1484
01:12:36.843 --> 01:12:38.178
<i>I'm happy you said it,
and not me.</i>


1485
01:12:40.096 --> 01:12:41.347
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1486
01:12:41.431 --> 01:12:42.640
- It's fucking great, Stagg.
- I love it.


1487
01:12:42.724 --> 01:12:44.267
- Yes.
- Oh, my...


1488
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:46.352
You know,
it's so brave actually.


1489
01:12:52.275 --> 01:12:53.193
I'm exhausted.

1490
01:12:53.276 --> 01:12:54.527
Yeah, me too.

1491
01:12:55.612 --> 01:12:57.238
I got to stay up
a few more hours


1492
01:12:57.322 --> 01:12:58.573
reading these books for...

1493
01:13:10.376 --> 01:13:11.419
Hey.

1494
01:13:12.503 --> 01:13:13.504
Hey.

1495
01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:16.424
Hey. Hey!

1496
01:13:17.675 --> 01:13:19.719
Bro. Oh, shit.

1497
01:13:19.802 --> 01:13:20.803
What are you doing here?

1498
01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.473
What am I doing here?
- What are you doing here?


1499
01:13:23.556 --> 01:13:24.557
What do you mean,
what am I doing?


1500
01:13:24.641 --> 01:13:25.516
Why are you in town?

1501
01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.185
I came to see our mother.

1502
01:13:27.268 --> 01:13:29.437
Ain't that what you been
calling me about
for weeks now?


1503
01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:32.899
What happened to your eye?

1504
01:13:32.982 --> 01:13:35.360
- I got into a fight.
- Yeah.


1505
01:13:35.443 --> 01:13:36.903
Well, get out of the pool.

1506
01:13:36.986 --> 01:13:38.279
- You're making a mess.
- I don't want


1507
01:13:38.363 --> 01:13:40.031
to get out of the pool.
I'm a grown-ass man.


1508
01:13:40.114 --> 01:13:41.241
This your girlfriend?

1509
01:13:41.324 --> 01:13:43.201
Yeah, you scared
the shit out of her.


1510
01:13:43.284 --> 01:13:44.911
I'm Coraline.

1511
01:13:45.828 --> 01:13:47.080
Hi, Coraline.

1512
01:13:47.163 --> 01:13:48.456
At least she's not
white again.


1513
01:13:48.539 --> 01:13:50.583
- Your wife was white.

1514
01:13:50.667 --> 01:13:52.418
My wife was a beard.
Beards don't count.


1515
01:13:52.502 --> 01:13:53.378
Well, get out.

1516
01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:54.879
You fucking menace.

1517
01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:56.047
You'll wake the neighbors.

1518
01:13:56.256 --> 01:13:57.131
You know,
fuck your neighbors!


1519
01:13:57.215 --> 01:13:58.800
And fuck your clean pool!

1520
01:13:58.883 --> 01:14:01.386
It's all just a part of your
superiority complex, anyway.


1521
01:14:01.469 --> 01:14:03.179
-  Fucking asshole.

1522
01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:09.602
- You are a goddamn child!

1523
01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:12.397
It's probably a bad time
to tell you,


1524
01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.564
but I did piss down there.

1525
01:14:13.648 --> 01:14:14.649
Fuck.

1526
01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:18.278
Oh, funny, huh?

1527
01:14:18.361 --> 01:14:19.487
I'm sorry, Monk.

1528
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:20.571
Don't get mad.

1529
01:14:21.864 --> 01:14:23.074
Get out of here.

1530
01:14:24.284 --> 01:14:25.410
You want a piece of me?

1531
01:14:30.957 --> 01:14:31.958
It's funny, huh?

1532
01:14:33.543 --> 01:14:35.878
So I'm lying
in bed with him,


1533
01:14:35.962 --> 01:14:38.464
butt-ass naked

1534
01:14:38.548 --> 01:14:41.092
and in walks Claude
carrying the frozen yogurt.


1535
01:14:41.175 --> 01:14:42.885
- No.
- Yeah, I forgot I'd shown him


1536
01:14:42.969 --> 01:14:44.262
where I keep the spare key.

1537
01:14:45.221 --> 01:14:48.266
So he just throws
the yogurt at us


1538
01:14:48.349 --> 01:14:50.727
and then he wallops me
right in the eye.


1539
01:14:52.895 --> 01:14:54.355
What was the other guy doing?

1540
01:14:54.439 --> 01:14:55.898
He couldn't stop laughing.

1541
01:14:55.982 --> 01:14:57.734
He said that's what he does
when he gets nervous.


1542
01:14:57.817 --> 01:14:58.985
Okay.

1543
01:14:59.068 --> 01:15:00.820
You really going for it
these days.


1544
01:15:00.903 --> 01:15:02.655
I only been gay for,
like, five minutes,


1545
01:15:02.739 --> 01:15:03.990
I got to make up
for lost time.


1546
01:15:04.073 --> 01:15:05.992
Yeah. Well, good for you.

1547
01:15:06.075 --> 01:15:07.660
I mean, the whole world's
falling apart.


1548
01:15:07.744 --> 01:15:09.162
Might as well have some fun.

1549
01:15:09.245 --> 01:15:10.663
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.


1550
01:15:11.706 --> 01:15:12.999
You know,
you're quite beautiful.


1551
01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:15.626
Thank you.

1552
01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:19.922
What do you see in my brother?

1553
01:15:21.424 --> 01:15:23.301
- He's funny.
-  Mm.


1554
01:15:23.384 --> 01:15:26.220
- He's not funny. No.
- No, not ha-ha funny.


1555
01:15:26.304 --> 01:15:28.931
- Like, sad funny.
-  Okay.


1556
01:15:29.015 --> 01:15:30.808
Like
a three-legged dog.


1557
01:15:30.892 --> 01:15:33.019
I see it now. Like somebody
dying on a toilet.


1558
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:35.021
Exactly.

1559
01:15:35.104 --> 01:15:36.689
- Exactly.
- Invariably,


1560
01:15:36.773 --> 01:15:39.275
- you go too far.
-  You think?


1561
01:15:39.359 --> 01:15:40.610
I don't think I go far enough.

1562
01:15:40.693 --> 01:15:41.778
It's becoming hurtful.

1563
01:15:41.861 --> 01:15:43.321
-  Aw.
- See?


1564
01:15:43.404 --> 01:15:44.405
- See?
-  "You know,


1565
01:15:44.489 --> 01:15:45.281
- invariably..."
-  Oh.


1566
01:15:45.365 --> 01:15:47.492
"...you go too far."

1567
01:15:47.575 --> 01:15:49.535
-  Yeah.

1568
01:15:49.619 --> 01:15:50.828
- You got a kiss, man.

1569
01:15:50.912 --> 01:15:53.623
Look at you.
Just by being pathetic.


1570
01:15:53.706 --> 01:15:54.832
- God bless you.
- Hey.


1571
01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:56.542
-  That is like

1572
01:15:56.626 --> 01:15:57.835
- a three-legged dog.
-  Hey.


1573
01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.386
Oh, this is nice.

1574
01:16:06.469 --> 01:16:07.553
Yeah, it's not bad.

1575
01:16:08.596 --> 01:16:10.098
What do you got there, pergola?

1576
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:11.182
No, that's a gazebo.

1577
01:16:12.058 --> 01:16:13.142
Same difference.

1578
01:16:13.226 --> 01:16:14.102
- All right?
-  To the left.


1579
01:16:14.185 --> 01:16:15.228
Oh. Excuse me.

1580
01:16:17.271 --> 01:16:18.272
Huh.

1581
01:16:19.774 --> 01:16:21.609
Hey, Monk?

1582
01:16:21.692 --> 01:16:23.444
How the hell
can you afford this place?


1583
01:16:24.654 --> 01:16:25.655
I, um...

1584
01:16:27.407 --> 01:16:31.285
Well, there was some money
Lisa left for Mother.


1585
01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:32.745
Thought the divorce
cleaned her out.


1586
01:16:34.372 --> 01:16:37.125
Well, I'm not familiar with
what her finances were like,


1587
01:16:37.208 --> 01:16:39.210
but if you're so interested
in the bills,


1588
01:16:39.293 --> 01:16:41.170
perhaps I can start
sending them to you?


1589
01:16:41.254 --> 01:16:42.964
Ah, it's fine. 
Where we going?

1590
01:16:43.047 --> 01:16:44.048
Right here. 44.

1591
01:16:46.092 --> 01:16:47.385
Surprise!

1592
01:16:51.722 --> 01:16:53.683
We've had a difficult morning.

1593
01:16:57.687 --> 01:16:59.564
We had to sedate her
after she tried
to strike a nurse.


1594
01:17:00.565 --> 01:17:02.692
- Has she done that before?
- No.


1595
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:05.486
She has a different
demeanor every day.


1596
01:17:06.237 --> 01:17:08.030
Sometimes every hour.

1597
01:17:08.114 --> 01:17:09.907
But maybe
she'll feel better tomorrow.


1598
01:17:10.783 --> 01:17:12.410
I'm sorry, I need to go.

1599
01:17:12.493 --> 01:17:14.662
Yes, of course. Thank you.

1600
01:17:16.289 --> 01:17:17.373
The gardener cut these

1601
01:17:17.457 --> 01:17:19.625
right off the bush
for your mom.


1602
01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:21.711
- Sweet, right?
- Yeah, that's great.


1603
01:17:22.837 --> 01:17:24.422
How can you afford this place?

1604
01:17:25.047 --> 01:17:26.257
I mean, you're not

1605
01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.050
a drug dealer
or something, are you?


1606
01:17:29.093 --> 01:17:30.720
No, I'm a writer.

1607
01:17:30.803 --> 01:17:33.264
And you're my girlfriend,
not my bookkeeper.

01:19:03.688 --> 01:19:04.981
It's better if I go.

1626
01:19:10.319 --> 01:19:12.154
It was nice
to meet you, Cliff.


1627
01:19:16.742 --> 01:19:18.286
This family will break
your heart.


1628
01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:49.609
Welcome back.
I'm Kenya Dunston


1629
01:19:49.692 --> 01:19:51.193
and today,
we're going to discuss


1630
01:19:51.277 --> 01:19:53.613
a new novel that just debuted
at number one


1631
01:19:53.696 --> 01:19:55.906
on <i>The New York Times</i>
bestseller list.


1632
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:59.744
It is just a remarkable,
special book,


1633
01:19:59.827 --> 01:20:01.662
and it's called...

1634
01:20:01.746 --> 01:20:03.789
Cover your kids' eyes
and ears...


1635
01:20:07.001 --> 01:20:08.252
We are lucky enough

1636
01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:10.171
to have the author
with us today.


1637
01:20:10.254 --> 01:20:12.506
And for those of you
who are just joining us,


1638
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:14.216
please know
that Mr. Stagg R. Leigh


1639
01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.677
is coming to us
from an undisclosed location


1640
01:20:16.761 --> 01:20:18.888
as he is still on the run
from authorities.


1641
01:20:20.681 --> 01:20:24.644
Oh, Stagg, tell us,
is this novel a true story?


1642
01:20:24.727 --> 01:20:26.437
<i>Not factually,</i>

1643
01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.314
<i>but it's the true story
of what it's like</i>


1644
01:20:28.397 --> 01:20:31.317
<i>to be a Black man
in America like me.</i>


1645
01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.360
<i>And it ain't pretty.</i>

1646
01:20:32.443 --> 01:20:33.694
Amen to that.

1647
01:20:33.778 --> 01:20:35.613
<i>During my time
in prison,</i>


1648
01:20:35.696 --> 01:20:38.616
<i>I learned that words belong
to everybody.</i>


1649
01:20:38.699 --> 01:20:40.534
<i>So this book
is my contribution</i>


1650
01:20:40.618 --> 01:20:42.411
<i>to this wonderful country
of ours</i>


1651
01:20:42.495 --> 01:20:44.580
<i>where a Black ex-con
can become rich</i>


1652
01:20:44.664 --> 01:20:47.750
<i>simply by telling the story
of his unfortunate people.</i>


1653
01:20:47.833 --> 01:20:49.335
Hm.

1654
01:20:49.418 --> 01:20:51.128
- Yes. Yes.

1655
01:20:54.632 --> 01:20:55.758
- Yeah.
-  <i>Get this.</i>


1656
01:20:55.841 --> 01:20:57.510
The FBI called
Thompson Watt today


1657
01:20:57.593 --> 01:20:59.345
to try to get
Stagg R. Leigh's identity.


1658
01:20:59.428 --> 01:21:00.930
- What?
-  <i>Don't worry.</i>


1659
01:21:01.013 --> 01:21:02.723
<i>They're not going
to give him up.</i>


1660
01:21:02.807 --> 01:21:04.892
Give who up? It's me,
I haven't done anything.


1661
01:21:04.975 --> 01:21:06.477
They don't know that.

1662
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.063
- Look, this has gone too far.
-  <i>Relax.</i>


1663
01:21:09.146 --> 01:21:10.314
The fugitive stuff's
getting us


1664
01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:11.607
mountains of free press.

1665
01:21:11.691 --> 01:21:12.775
- Plus, as you said,

1666
01:21:12.858 --> 01:21:13.984
you haven't done anything.

1667
01:21:14.068 --> 01:21:15.653
It's not like
they can arrest you.


1668
01:21:15.736 --> 01:21:18.197
I wish I could go back
to not selling books.


1669
01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.281
- I don't.

1670
01:21:20.241 --> 01:21:21.450
<i>Bye.</i>

1671
01:21:35.673 --> 01:21:36.674
Is everything all right?

1672
01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.552
Yeah.

1673
01:21:39.635 --> 01:21:42.596
I'm just a little
stressed out. This, uh.


1674
01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.640
book award stuff is a bit
more work than I expected.


1675
01:21:45.558 --> 01:21:46.559
Hm.

1676
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.061
- Mm.

1677
01:21:49.979 --> 01:21:51.021
Shit.

1678
01:21:52.356 --> 01:21:54.734
It's no biggie.
Got more forks in the kitchen.


1679
01:22:12.168 --> 01:22:13.169
What's this?

1680
01:22:13.252 --> 01:22:15.254
Mm. My friend got it for me.

1681
01:22:16.547 --> 01:22:17.506
Have you read it?

1682
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:19.008
Of course not, have you?

1683
01:22:19.091 --> 01:22:20.092
Yeah.

1684
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.388
And what did you think of it?

1685
01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.974
- I liked it.
- What did you like about it?


1686
01:22:27.057 --> 01:22:29.518
-  Um...
- It didn't offend you?


1687
01:22:29.602 --> 01:22:30.603
You just said
you didn't read it.


1688
01:22:30.686 --> 01:22:31.645
What's your problem?

1689
01:22:31.729 --> 01:22:33.189
No, you answer my question.

1690
01:22:33.272 --> 01:22:34.565
You answer mine.

1691
01:22:36.233 --> 01:22:39.862
My problem is that
books like this aren't real.


1692
01:22:40.738 --> 01:22:41.947
They flatten our lives.

1693
01:22:42.031 --> 01:22:43.157
What do you mean?

1694
01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.325
I mean, that...

1695
01:22:44.408 --> 01:22:46.410
you know,
my life is a disaster,


1696
01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:48.078
but not in the way you'd think
reading this shit.


1697
01:22:48.871 --> 01:22:50.581
These things reduce us

1698
01:22:50.664 --> 01:22:53.000
and they do it
over and over again because


1699
01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:56.045
too many white people,
and people apparently like you


1700
01:22:56.128 --> 01:22:58.672
devour this slop
like pigs at a dumpster


1701
01:22:58.756 --> 01:23:01.258
to stay current
at fucking cocktail parties


1702
01:23:01.342 --> 01:23:02.676
- or whatever.
- Okay, um...


1703
01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.345
You got a lot of opinions
for someone


1704
01:23:04.428 --> 01:23:06.388
who hasn't published anything
for years.


1705
01:23:06.472 --> 01:23:07.515
And you've published
what exactly?


1706
01:23:07.598 --> 01:23:09.350
Okay, what is wrong with you?

1707
01:23:10.267 --> 01:23:11.352
Why are you acting like this?

1708
01:23:11.435 --> 01:23:12.770
I'm not acting like anything.

1709
01:23:12.853 --> 01:23:14.855
You've been acting
like a weirdo for weeks.


1710
01:23:14.939 --> 01:23:16.857
You've been obfuscating,
sneaking around.


1711
01:23:16.941 --> 01:23:18.400
You're fucking unknowable.

1712
01:23:18.484 --> 01:23:20.778
Maybe you think being
an enigma is chic and artsy.


1713
01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:22.613
I just think it makes you
an asshole.


1714
01:23:22.696 --> 01:23:24.031
Well, um,

1715
01:23:24.114 --> 01:23:26.033
you don't understand my life,
and you can't,


1716
01:23:26.116 --> 01:23:27.159
so just leave it at that.

1717
01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:32.498
One day, maybe you'll learn

1718
01:23:32.581 --> 01:23:34.625
that not being able
to relate to other people


1719
01:23:34.708 --> 01:23:36.836
isn't a badge of honor.

1720
01:23:41.966 --> 01:23:43.217
I think you should leave.

1721
01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.260
Well, you know what I think?

1722
01:23:44.343 --> 01:23:46.178
You should leave, Monk.

1723
01:24:02.361 --> 01:24:03.654
Nonsense.

1724
01:24:28.137 --> 01:24:29.430
You guys need
any help with that?


1725
01:24:29.513 --> 01:24:30.556
Nah, we're good.

1726
01:24:32.558 --> 01:24:34.935
I thought you could use
a little brawn.


1727
01:24:35.019 --> 01:24:38.022
-  We got it.
-  Mr. Monk.


1728
01:24:38.105 --> 01:24:39.565
You mind I keep
the soda maker?


1729
01:24:39.648 --> 01:24:41.859
You don't like the bubbly
water anyhow, right?


1730
01:24:41.942 --> 01:24:43.986
- It's all yours.
-  Thank you.


1731
01:24:46.363 --> 01:24:49.199
Um... Hey, what about this?

1732
01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:53.287
No. I always hated that color.

1733
01:24:53.370 --> 01:24:55.247
It's just the one
your father bought.


1734
01:24:56.498 --> 01:24:58.876
Thelonious,
this just came for you.


1735
01:24:59.835 --> 01:25:00.920
Okay, thanks.

1736
01:25:01.003 --> 01:25:02.004
This is
the last of it.


1737
01:25:03.005 --> 01:25:04.298
Goodbye, Mr. Monk.

1738
01:25:07.968 --> 01:25:09.053
Bye, Lorraine.

1739
01:25:15.726 --> 01:25:16.810
Drive safe.

1740
01:25:16.894 --> 01:25:18.270
Guess I'll see you
at the wedding.


1741
01:25:18.354 --> 01:25:19.355
All right.

1742
01:25:23.484 --> 01:25:24.485
I'll take that there.

1743
01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:48.926
Thompson Watt apparently raced
to publish it.


1744
01:25:49.009 --> 01:25:51.345
Yeah, I heard that they ran

1745
01:25:51.428 --> 01:25:52.888
and they're reprinting
more soon.


1746
01:25:52.972 --> 01:25:54.473
I mean, it's going
like gangbusters <i>.</i>


1747
01:25:54.556 --> 01:25:55.975
Christ on a crutch!

1748
01:25:56.058 --> 01:25:57.685
It better be good.

1749
01:25:57.768 --> 01:25:59.979
<i>Hey, I heard
the writer's a fugitive.</i>


1750
01:26:00.062 --> 01:26:01.522
Well, that would
explain the title.


1751
01:26:01.605 --> 01:26:02.898
He didn't go to charm school.

1752
01:26:02.982 --> 01:26:05.985
No, I think that
that background is a plus.


1753
01:26:06.068 --> 01:26:08.195
I am thrilled

1754
01:26:08.278 --> 01:26:11.532
to read a BIPOC man
harmed by our carceral state.


1755
01:26:11.615 --> 01:26:14.159
<i>Are you one of those
defund the police nuts?</i>


1756
01:26:14.243 --> 01:26:17.246
Yes, and I wouldn't expect you
to understand.


1757
01:26:17.329 --> 01:26:20.124
Well, I hope someone you love
doesn't get raped or murdered.


1758
01:26:20.207 --> 01:26:22.543
Can we not talk
about this now, please?


1759
01:26:22.626 --> 01:26:24.503
Look, look, look.
Criminal or not,


1760
01:26:24.586 --> 01:26:26.171
I don't think
we should add it.


1761
01:26:26.255 --> 01:26:27.798
We're already weeks
into the process,


1762
01:26:27.881 --> 01:26:29.216
and I don't know
about any of you,


1763
01:26:29.299 --> 01:26:30.592
but I've got more
than a dozen books


1764
01:26:30.676 --> 01:26:33.178
I haven't even opened yet.

1765
01:26:33.262 --> 01:26:34.972
It was published
before the submission date,


1766
01:26:35.055 --> 01:26:36.515
I think we have to accept it.

1767
01:26:37.891 --> 01:26:40.769
<i>Yeah, it's just one more.</i>
And from the looks of it, it should be a
quick read.


1768
01:26:40.853 --> 01:26:41.937
A quick fuck.

1769
01:26:43.439 --> 01:26:44.857
<i>I've had a couple of those.</i>

1770
01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.651
- Bye, guys. Bye.

1771
01:27:23.479 --> 01:27:24.730
Hi, Monkie.

1772
01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.025
You look beautiful.

1773
01:27:43.123 --> 01:27:45.084
Oh, hello.

1774
01:27:45.167 --> 01:27:48.003
Monkie, do we know these men?

1775
01:27:48.087 --> 01:27:50.255
No, Mother,
this isn't the Alzheimer's,


1776
01:27:50.339 --> 01:27:52.466
these are actual strangers.
Who are you people?


1777
01:27:52.549 --> 01:27:54.093
We're Cliff's friends.

1778
01:27:54.176 --> 01:27:55.677
Of course, you are.

1779
01:27:55.761 --> 01:27:57.679
We met him a few days ago.
I'm Kenny, this is Alvin.


1780
01:27:57.763 --> 01:27:58.764
Are you Monk?

1781
01:27:58.847 --> 01:28:00.933
I am. How did you know?

1782
01:28:01.016 --> 01:28:03.811
Oh. Well, Cliff said
Monk's a real tight-ass.


1783
01:28:05.729 --> 01:28:06.897
Did he?

1784
01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.981
Delightful.

1785
01:28:08.649 --> 01:28:10.067
Mother, you sit here.

1786
01:28:11.652 --> 01:28:12.653
Lorraine?

1787
01:28:18.325 --> 01:28:19.493
Do you like
scrambled eggs?


1788
01:28:19.576 --> 01:28:21.078
I love scrambled eggs.

1789
01:28:21.161 --> 01:28:22.496
What the hell
are you doing here?


1790
01:28:22.579 --> 01:28:23.580
You first.

1791
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:28.585
Oh, shit, the wedding.

1792
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:30.170
- Ah.
-  Oh, fuck!


1793
01:28:32.047 --> 01:28:33.382
I didn't go to the airport.

1794
01:28:33.465 --> 01:28:36.635
That day I left,
I needed some time to myself.


1795
01:28:36.718 --> 01:28:39.429
Time to oneself implies
by definition, time alone.


1796
01:28:39.513 --> 01:28:40.973
Oh, Christ, here we go.

1797
01:28:41.056 --> 01:28:43.308
- Detective Dictionary.
-  Ah!


1798
01:28:43.392 --> 01:28:44.393
Mr. Cliff.

1799
01:28:44.476 --> 01:28:45.686
I'm sorry, guys,
I'll handle it.


1800
01:28:45.769 --> 01:28:47.771
You need to leave.

1801
01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:49.439
Don't bother to clean up,
just go.


1802
01:28:49.523 --> 01:28:51.191
Oh, no,
it's all right, just...


1803
01:28:51.275 --> 01:28:52.317
Please stay.

1804
01:28:52.401 --> 01:28:53.861
It's a celebration.

1805
01:28:55.529 --> 01:28:56.738
It's good to see you, Cliff.

1806
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:59.992
It's good to see you too,
Maynard.


1807
01:29:00.075 --> 01:29:01.535
I, um...

1808
01:29:01.618 --> 01:29:02.911
I... I don't want to impose.

1809
01:29:02.995 --> 01:29:04.246
You can't impose.

1810
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:06.331
You're family.

1811
01:29:21.597 --> 01:29:22.598
Okay.

1812
01:29:23.432 --> 01:29:24.975
I'll, uh...

1813
01:29:25.058 --> 01:29:26.268
I'll go clean up a bit, yeah?

1814
01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.813
Congratulations, you guys.

1815
01:29:35.319 --> 01:29:36.778
Can we make
y'all some breakfast?


1816
01:29:36.862 --> 01:29:38.572
I can whip up
a killer smoothie


1817
01:29:38.655 --> 01:29:40.324
and Alvin used to work
the omelet station
on a cruise ship.


1818
01:29:40.407 --> 01:29:43.118
That sounds lovely.
Thank you.


1819
01:29:47.956 --> 01:29:49.291
It's very kind of you
to let them stay.


1820
01:29:49.374 --> 01:29:50.334
Oh.

1821
01:29:50.417 --> 01:29:51.793
It's always easier dealing

1822
01:29:51.877 --> 01:29:53.795
with other people's families
than your own.


1823
01:29:55.297 --> 01:29:58.091
I regret to inform you
that in a couple hours,


1824
01:29:58.175 --> 01:29:59.635
this will be your family.

Piss her off?

1842
01:32:02.632 --> 01:32:03.592
Yeah.

1843
01:32:03.675 --> 01:32:06.553
- Shut her out?
- Yeah.


1844
01:32:08.221 --> 01:32:09.556
Dad shut everyone out too.

1845
01:32:10.474 --> 01:32:11.850
He lied all the time.

1846
01:32:12.934 --> 01:32:14.019
Look how that turned out.

1847
01:32:17.606 --> 01:32:18.857
I find myself

1848
01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:22.319
getting very angry
these days like Dad.


1849
01:32:23.278 --> 01:32:24.279
These days?

1850
01:32:30.285 --> 01:32:32.829
I've been thinking a lot
lately about


1851
01:32:32.913 --> 01:32:34.873
how Dad died
not knowing I'm gay.


1852
01:32:38.168 --> 01:32:40.170
- I think he suspected it.
- Mm.


1853
01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:42.381
He may have.

1854
01:32:43.256 --> 01:32:44.633
But he didn't know for sure.

1855
01:32:46.051 --> 01:32:48.678
He never knew
the entirety of me.


1856
01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:51.098
And now he never will.

1857
01:32:52.933 --> 01:32:54.684
And that makes me...

1858
01:32:55.811 --> 01:32:57.104
It makes me real sad.

1859
01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.235
Well, what if he had known
and rejected you?


1860
01:33:03.318 --> 01:33:05.987
At least he'd be rejecting
the real me.


1861
01:33:08.824 --> 01:33:10.409
I know that sounds crazy,

1862
01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:13.203
but there'd be some relief
in that.


1863
01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.458
It doesn't sound so crazy.

1864
01:33:23.630 --> 01:33:25.298
People want
to love you, Monk.


1865
01:33:28.093 --> 01:33:30.762
I personally don't know
what they see in you, but...


1866
01:33:32.722 --> 01:33:33.723
they want to love you.

1867
01:33:36.601 --> 01:33:38.228
You should let them love
all of you.


1868
01:34:12.471 --> 01:34:14.055
It was dogshit.

1869
01:34:14.139 --> 01:34:16.308
I mean,
some mollycoddled chump


1870
01:34:16.391 --> 01:34:18.810
faffing on
about his dead mom...


1871
01:34:18.894 --> 01:34:20.812
Who cares?

1872
01:34:20.896 --> 01:34:23.982
Okay, so that means that
<i>Bury Me Standing</i> is fourth.


1873
01:34:26.318 --> 01:34:27.736
Let's talk about <i>Fuck.</i>

1874
01:34:27.819 --> 01:34:29.154
Could we not?

1875
01:34:29.237 --> 01:34:31.406
Personally,
I adored it.


1876
01:34:32.657 --> 01:34:35.577
It was like gazing
into an open wound.


1877
01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:37.078
I agree.

1878
01:34:37.162 --> 01:34:39.331
I think it's the strongest
African-American novel


1879
01:34:39.414 --> 01:34:41.124
I've read in a long time.

1880
01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:44.586
I mean, since yours.

1881
01:34:44.669 --> 01:34:47.339
- Of course, Sintara.
- Thank you.


1882
01:34:47.422 --> 01:34:49.591
You know, I actually liked it

1883
01:34:49.674 --> 01:34:51.134
much more
than I was expecting.


1884
01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:53.887
I mean,
this is a gutsy piece of work.


1885
01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:55.931
And necessary for the times.

1886
01:34:56.932 --> 01:34:58.350
What did you think, Sintara?

1887
01:34:59.893 --> 01:35:03.104
I found it to be
pretty pandering, actually.


1888
01:35:03.188 --> 01:35:04.189
You did?

1889
01:35:05.023 --> 01:35:06.441
Yes. Did you not?

1890
01:35:07.150 --> 01:35:08.568
I very much did.

1891
01:35:08.652 --> 01:35:12.072
I thought it was simplistic
and meaningless.


1892
01:35:12.155 --> 01:35:14.199
Well, of course,
it was simplistic.


1893
01:35:14.282 --> 01:35:17.285
I mean, it's the language
of the gutter.


1894
01:35:17.369 --> 01:35:19.871
You know, not some
prissy graduate thesis.


1895
01:35:19.955 --> 01:35:22.082
"Language of the gutter."
Jesus Christ.


1896
01:35:22.165 --> 01:35:23.708
I think our blood sugar's low.

1897
01:35:23.792 --> 01:35:25.585
How about we take a break
for lunch, huh?


1898
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:27.254
- Fine by me.
-  Okay.


1899
01:35:27.337 --> 01:35:28.338
-  Okay.
- Really?


1900
01:35:29.172 --> 01:35:30.590
Okay.

1901
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:42.978
Oh, I'm sorry.

1902
01:35:43.061 --> 01:35:44.187
Oh, no, you're fine.

1903
01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:45.146
What,
I'm not interrupting?


1904
01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:46.898
- No.

1905
01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:09.421
Sorry.

1906
01:36:25.562 --> 01:36:27.063
Do you mind
if I ask you something?


1907
01:36:27.814 --> 01:36:28.815
Sure.

1908
01:36:29.816 --> 01:36:31.443
Um...

1909
01:36:31.526 --> 01:36:33.778
What about <i>Fuck</i>
did you find pandering?


1910
01:36:34.487 --> 01:36:35.488
Oh, uh...

1911
01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:39.200
I can't really put my finger
on it, but...


1912
01:36:40.827 --> 01:36:42.746
it's not different from
some of what's out there,


1913
01:36:42.829 --> 01:36:43.872
but it just felt...

1914
01:36:45.707 --> 01:36:47.375
soulless...

1915
01:36:47.459 --> 01:36:49.794
is the word
that I'm going to use.


1916
01:36:49.878 --> 01:36:51.087
You said you agreed, right?

1917
01:36:51.171 --> 01:36:52.964
Yeah, I do.
I think it seems written


1918
01:36:53.048 --> 01:36:56.176
to satisfy the tastes
of guilt-ridden white people.


1919
01:36:56.259 --> 01:36:58.637
Yeah, the kind of book
critics call important


1920
01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.430
and necessary,
but not well-written.


1921
01:37:00.513 --> 01:37:02.015
-  Exactly.

1922
01:37:06.311 --> 01:37:10.523
Okay, so... And please
don't take offense at this,


1923
01:37:10.607 --> 01:37:13.234
but how is <i>Fuck</i>

1924
01:37:13.318 --> 01:37:15.737
so very different
from your book?


1925
01:37:19.616 --> 01:37:21.701
Is that what this is about?

1926
01:37:21.785 --> 01:37:23.286
- You think my book's trash?
-  No.


1927
01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:27.248
To be honest,
I haven't read your book.


1928
01:37:27.332 --> 01:37:29.125
I've read excerpts

1929
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:32.796
and it didn't seem
so dissimilar.


1930
01:37:34.756 --> 01:37:37.676
I did a lot of research
for my book.


1931
01:37:37.759 --> 01:37:40.011
Some of it was actually taken
from real interviews.


1932
01:37:40.845 --> 01:37:42.138
Maybe you've been up

1933
01:37:42.222 --> 01:37:44.265
in your ivory tower
of academia for so long


1934
01:37:44.349 --> 01:37:46.518
you've forgotten that some
people's lives are hard.


1935
01:37:46.601 --> 01:37:47.644
Your life?

1936
01:37:50.146 --> 01:37:52.732
You went to an exclusive
bohemian college.


1937
01:37:52.816 --> 01:37:54.901
You had a job at a fancy

1938
01:37:54.984 --> 01:37:56.653
publishing house in New York.

1939
01:37:56.736 --> 01:37:59.531
So what? I don't need
to write about my life.


1940
01:37:59.614 --> 01:38:01.074
I write about
what interests people.


1941
01:38:02.409 --> 01:38:04.536
You write what interests
white publishers


1942
01:38:04.619 --> 01:38:07.288
fiending Black trauma porn.

1943
01:38:07.372 --> 01:38:09.040
They're the one buying
the manuscripts.


1944
01:38:10.458 --> 01:38:12.585
Is it bad to cater
to their tastes?


1945
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:14.629
If you're okay feeding

1946
01:38:14.713 --> 01:38:16.172
people's base desires
for profit--


1947
01:38:16.256 --> 01:38:18.216
I'm okay with giving
the market what it wants.


1948
01:38:18.299 --> 01:38:19.884
That's how drug dealers
excuse themselves.


1949
01:38:19.968 --> 01:38:21.511
And I think drugs
should be legal.


1950
01:38:26.224 --> 01:38:29.227
But you're not fed up with it?

1951
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:31.604
You know, Black people
in poverty?


1952
01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:34.107
Black people rapping?

1953
01:38:34.190 --> 01:38:35.567
Black people as slaves?

1954
01:38:35.650 --> 01:38:37.944
Black people murdered
by the police?


1955
01:38:38.027 --> 01:38:39.028
Old soaring narratives
about...


1956
01:38:39.112 --> 01:38:40.238
Okay.

1957
01:38:40.321 --> 01:38:42.198
Black folks
in dire circumstances


1958
01:38:42.282 --> 01:38:45.118
who still managed to maintain
their dignity before they die?


1959
01:38:45.201 --> 01:38:47.787
I mean, I'm not saying
these things aren't real,


1960
01:38:47.871 --> 01:38:50.999
but we're also more than this.

1961
01:38:51.082 --> 01:38:54.085
And it's like so many writers
like you can't envision us


1962
01:38:54.169 --> 01:38:56.379
without some white boot
on our necks.


1963
01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:59.174
Do you get angry
at Bret Easton Ellis


1964
01:38:59.257 --> 01:39:00.633
or Charles Bukowski

1965
01:39:00.717 --> 01:39:02.385
for writing
about the downtrodden?


1966
01:39:02.469 --> 01:39:04.637
Or is your ire strictly
reserved for Black women?


1967
01:39:04.721 --> 01:39:06.556
Nobody reads Bukowski thinking

1968
01:39:06.639 --> 01:39:08.475
his is the definitive
white experience.


1969
01:39:08.558 --> 01:39:10.393
But people, white people,

1970
01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:12.645
read your book
and confine us to it.


1971
01:39:12.729 --> 01:39:14.981
They think
that we're all like that.


1972
01:39:15.064 --> 01:39:16.733
Then it sounds like your issue

1973
01:39:16.816 --> 01:39:18.818
is with white people, Monk,
not me.


1974
01:39:18.902 --> 01:39:20.570
Well, maybe, but I also think

1975
01:39:20.653 --> 01:39:22.238
that I see
the unrealized potential


1976
01:39:22.322 --> 01:39:23.490
of Black people
in this country.


1977
01:39:26.785 --> 01:39:29.412
Potential is what people see
when they think


1978
01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:31.247
what's in front of them
isn't good enough.


1979
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:43.259
So, what are we talking about?

1980
01:40:32.225 --> 01:40:33.268
We're starting again.

1981
01:40:33.351 --> 01:40:34.477
I'll be right there.

1982
01:40:46.155 --> 01:40:48.449
Hey, can I speak to Arthur?
Yeah, it's Monk.


1983
01:40:51.494 --> 01:40:52.453
Hey.

1984
01:40:52.537 --> 01:40:53.955
I'm fine.

1985
01:40:54.038 --> 01:40:55.790
Listen, you think
you can set up


1986
01:40:55.874 --> 01:40:57.166
another meeting with Wiley?

1987
01:40:58.251 --> 01:41:00.128
I've got a new idea for him.

1988
01:41:00.211 --> 01:41:02.005
Different kind of movie.

1989
01:41:02.088 --> 01:41:03.089
Thanks.

1990
01:41:17.437 --> 01:41:19.147
I think it's <i>Fuck</i> for me.

1991
01:41:19.230 --> 01:41:20.982
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, I agree.


1992
01:41:21.065 --> 01:41:22.901
I disagree. I'm sorry.

1993
01:41:22.984 --> 01:41:25.278
I think it would be a mistake

1994
01:41:25.361 --> 01:41:27.780
to award this book anything.

1995
01:41:27.864 --> 01:41:29.407
Well, it's two
versus three, so...


1996
01:41:30.533 --> 01:41:31.534
<i>Fuck's</i> the winner.

1997
01:41:31.618 --> 01:41:33.036
<i>Fuck</i> is the winner.

1998
01:41:36.456 --> 01:41:39.000
You know, it's not just
that it's so affecting,


1999
01:41:40.126 --> 01:41:41.753
I just think it's essential

2000
01:41:41.836 --> 01:41:43.379
to listen to Black voices
right now.


2001
01:41:51.721 --> 01:41:52.722
Mother.

2002
01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:55.141
Did you...

2003
01:41:58.561 --> 01:42:00.647
Did you know that Dad
was cheating on you?


2004
01:42:01.856 --> 01:42:04.192
He was bad at keeping secrets.

2005
01:42:04.275 --> 01:42:06.653
Why didn't you leave him?

2006
01:42:06.736 --> 01:42:09.280
He would've been
even more lonely without me.


2007
01:42:12.075 --> 01:42:13.326
You thought he was lonely?

2008
01:42:13.409 --> 01:42:15.286
You father was a genius.

2009
01:42:18.081 --> 01:42:21.042
Geniuses are lonely...

2010
01:42:22.418 --> 01:42:25.880
because they can't connect
with the rest of us.


2011
01:42:27.966 --> 01:42:29.467
You're a genius, son.

2012
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:34.472
Well, I certainly don't
feel like one half the time.


2013
01:42:35.807 --> 01:42:37.016
That's because
you've always been


2014
01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:38.977
so hard on yourself, Cliffy.

2015
01:42:46.192 --> 01:42:49.946
And now for the final
award for the evening.


2016
01:42:50.029 --> 01:42:53.533
I promise to leave you alone,
let you eat after this.


2017
01:42:53.616 --> 01:42:55.118
But before
I announce the winner,


2018
01:42:55.201 --> 01:42:56.828
I would like to acknowledge
our judges,


2019
01:42:56.911 --> 01:42:58.871
our incredibly
diverse group of judges


2020
01:42:58.955 --> 01:43:01.040
who've sacrificed
valuable time,


2021
01:43:01.124 --> 01:43:02.750
so we could all
celebrate here tonight.


2022
01:43:02.834 --> 01:43:03.835
So if you put
your hands together,


2023
01:43:03.918 --> 01:43:05.420
they did a fantastic job.

2024
01:43:10.466 --> 01:43:11.467
Okay.

2025
01:43:12.176 --> 01:43:13.344
Without further ado,

2026
01:43:14.679 --> 01:43:17.223
this year's Literary Award
goes to...


2027
01:43:18.433 --> 01:43:19.726
Oh, I knew it.

2028
01:43:19.809 --> 01:43:22.228
By Stagg R. Leigh, <i>Fuck.</i>

2029
01:43:33.531 --> 01:43:35.867
Well, I'm not sure
if Mr. Leigh
is going to grace us


2030
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:37.410
with his presence here
tonight.


2031
01:43:37.493 --> 01:43:40.204
He's notoriously cagey
about attention.


2032
01:43:51.466 --> 01:43:53.134
Oh, hold on.

2033
01:43:53.217 --> 01:43:55.845
Oh, okay. I see some business.

2034
01:43:55.928 --> 01:43:59.724
Someone's coming.
Oh, Thelonious Ellison.


2035
01:43:59.807 --> 01:44:01.642
One of our esteemed judges.

2036
01:44:04.687 --> 01:44:06.522
Weirdly walking
toward the stage.


2037
01:44:08.191 --> 01:44:09.776
No idea why.

2038
01:44:10.568 --> 01:44:11.444
Hey.

2039
01:44:11.527 --> 01:44:12.612
What's going on?

2040
01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:15.281
Excuse me.

2041
01:44:16.616 --> 01:44:18.076
Excuse me.

2042
01:44:34.383 --> 01:44:36.094
I have a confession to make.

2043
01:44:41.474 --> 01:44:43.351
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Smash to black?</i>


2044
01:44:45.853 --> 01:44:47.480
No fucking way, dude.

2045
01:44:47.563 --> 01:44:49.023
What's wrong with that?

2046
01:44:49.107 --> 01:44:51.651
There's no resolution here.
What's he going to say?


2047
01:44:51.734 --> 01:44:53.611
I don't know.
I think that's what's
interesting about it.


2048
01:44:53.694 --> 01:44:54.779
No, he should say something.

2049
01:44:54.862 --> 01:44:56.280
What did you say?

2050
01:44:56.364 --> 01:44:58.533
Nothing. I walked out
of the ceremony.


2051
01:44:58.616 --> 01:44:59.784
The next day
I called you to say


2052
01:44:59.867 --> 01:45:01.244
I wanted to write this movie.

2053
01:45:01.327 --> 01:45:02.620
Well, Monk,
the character


2054
01:45:02.703 --> 01:45:03.996
should say something.

2055
01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.082
Well, I don't want him
to make some


2056
01:45:06.165 --> 01:45:08.251
grandiose speech
spoon-feeding everyone


2057
01:45:08.334 --> 01:45:09.627
the moral of the story.

2058
01:45:09.710 --> 01:45:11.712
There is no moral.
That's the idea.


2059
01:45:11.796 --> 01:45:13.047
I like the ambiguity.

2060
01:45:13.131 --> 01:45:15.216
Okay, look.
You're a good writer,


2061
01:45:15.299 --> 01:45:17.426
and this is almost there.

2062
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:19.637
But novels
aren't movies, okay?


2063
01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.681
Nuance doesn't put asses
in theater seats.


2064
01:45:21.764 --> 01:45:23.224
We need a big finish.
What is this?


2065
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:26.644
It's the seltzer
you asked for.


2066
01:45:26.727 --> 01:45:27.812
Why is it all wet?

2067
01:45:29.313 --> 01:45:30.648
Condensation?

2068
01:45:30.731 --> 01:45:32.400
Condensation. Okay.

2069
01:45:32.483 --> 01:45:34.193
You're a fucking
weatherman now.


2070
01:45:34.277 --> 01:45:35.361
You want anything?

2071
01:45:35.444 --> 01:45:36.904
Uh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

2072
01:45:36.988 --> 01:45:38.114
All right. This is Monk.

2073
01:45:38.197 --> 01:45:41.033
- We're going to make a movie with him if
he can get the third act right.
- Nice meeting you.


2074
01:45:41.117 --> 01:45:42.243
- You as well.
- Get me a flat white.


2075
01:45:43.077 --> 01:45:44.912
And, hey, never again.

2076
01:45:47.123 --> 01:45:48.666
All right.

2077
01:45:48.749 --> 01:45:50.334
What other endings you got
in that big brain of yours?


2078
01:45:54.172 --> 01:45:55.339
How about if...

2079
01:45:55.423 --> 01:45:57.884
This year's Literary Award
goes to...


2080
01:45:58.801 --> 01:46:01.262
by Stagg R. Leigh, <i>Fuck.</i>

2081
01:46:52.271 --> 01:46:54.023
I'd like to apologize.

2082
01:46:56.609 --> 01:46:58.486
I haven't been myself lately.

2083
01:47:20.091 --> 01:47:21.092
What about that?

2084
01:47:21.842 --> 01:47:22.885
Will she forgive him?

2085
01:47:24.387 --> 01:47:26.180
I don't know.

2086
01:47:26.264 --> 01:47:29.350
The real Coraline
won't return my phone calls.


2087
01:47:29.433 --> 01:47:31.519
Maybe the movie Coraline
is more forgiving.


2088
01:47:34.855 --> 01:47:36.649
No. It's too pat.

2089
01:47:36.732 --> 01:47:38.442
Makes the whole thing
feel like a romantic comedy.


2090
01:47:38.526 --> 01:47:40.194
We don't want
to make a romantic comedy.


2091
01:47:40.278 --> 01:47:41.779
We want
to make something real.


2092
01:47:42.905 --> 01:47:43.906
Give me something real.

2093
01:47:48.744 --> 01:47:49.870
I mean, we could just...

2094
01:47:51.163 --> 01:47:52.665
Hey, what's going on?

2095
01:47:53.541 --> 01:47:54.542
Excuse me.

2096
01:47:56.919 --> 01:47:57.920
Beat it.

2097
01:48:10.308 --> 01:48:13.352
I have a confession to make.

2098
01:48:13.436 --> 01:48:15.479
- Stagg Leigh,
on the ground now!


2099
01:48:15.563 --> 01:48:17.231
There he is!

2100
01:48:17.315 --> 01:48:19.150
No, no.
I'm not Stagg Leigh.


2101
01:48:20.318 --> 01:48:21.319
He doesn't exist.

2102
01:48:21.402 --> 01:48:23.487
I'm Monk. Thelonious Ellison.

2103
01:48:23.571 --> 01:48:25.614
You're a fugitive!
On the ground now!


2104
01:48:25.698 --> 01:48:26.866
No, no, no.

2105
01:48:26.949 --> 01:48:28.326
That was all
a marketing gimmick.


2106
01:48:28.409 --> 01:48:30.244
- It was all a lie.
-  He's got a gun!


2107
01:48:30.328 --> 01:48:31.704
No, no! No, no!

2108
01:49:04.153 --> 01:49:05.154
He's dead?

2109
01:49:06.572 --> 01:49:07.573
They smoke him?

2110
01:49:11.786 --> 01:49:12.787
It's perfect.

2111
01:49:14.538 --> 01:49:16.248
Yes! That is...

2112
01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:19.085
That is perfect.

2113
01:49:20.211 --> 01:49:22.296
Time to pick out your tux,
my brother.


2114
01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:23.964
We're going to the big show.

2115
01:49:24.048 --> 01:49:26.258
Hey, come transcribe this.
We got it.


2116
01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:30.721
Fuck.

2117
01:49:53.828 --> 01:49:54.829
Hey.

2118
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:00.501
So?

2119
01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:03.504
They going to make
your movie or what?


2120
01:50:04.255 --> 01:50:05.840
Unfortunately, yes.

2121
01:50:05.923 --> 01:50:07.925
Hey! You know what?

2122
01:50:08.008 --> 01:50:10.803
Good luck finding someone
handsome enough to play me.


2123
01:50:10.886 --> 01:50:12.221
I think they have.

2124
01:50:12.304 --> 01:50:13.305
Who they got?

2125
01:50:14.306 --> 01:50:15.307
Tyler Perry.

2126
01:50:18.144 --> 01:50:19.145
You got me. That's good.

2127
01:50:24.483 --> 01:50:25.609
All right.
