WEBVTT

02:58.500 --> 03:00.860
Excuse me.

03:03.370 --> 03:06.490
Come on, honey, let's
get you ready for bed.

03:18.950 --> 03:21.040
I am no one special,

03:21.080 --> 03:24.020
just a common man
with common thoughts.

03:24.050 --> 03:26.320
I've led a common life.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.260
There are no monuments
dedicated to me.

03:28.290 --> 03:31.390
And my name
will soon be forgotten.

03:31.430 --> 03:33.230
But in one respect,

03:33.260 --> 03:36.790
I've succeeded as gloriously
as anyone who ever lived.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.930
- Looking good, Duke.
- Feeling good.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.730
I've loved another
with all my heart

03:40.770 --> 03:44.800
and soul and for me
that has always been enough.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.240
How's it hanging, Harry?

03:46.280 --> 03:48.970
I keep trying to die,
but they won't let me.

03:49.010 --> 03:51.040
Well, you can't
have everything.

03:54.220 --> 03:55.450
Big day today.

03:55.490 --> 03:58.180
You say that every day,
you old devil.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.520
It's a lovely day
outside.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.790
Let's take a walk.

04:03.830 --> 04:04.890
I don't think so.

04:04.930 --> 04:07.230
Well, we've got to get
you out of this room.

04:07.260 --> 04:08.860
Come on now, honey.
Some fresh air

04:08.900 --> 04:11.330
- would do you good.
- Hello.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.600
I'm sorry,
it's not a good day.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.610
I don't think
she's up for anything.

04:17.640 --> 04:18.800
Hello?

04:20.640 --> 04:24.640
This is Duke,
he's come to read to you.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.950
- Read?
- Mm-hmm.

04:28.180 --> 04:31.020
No.
I don't know.

04:31.050 --> 04:35.120
Oh, come on,
you'll like him, he's very funny.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.170
Ahh...

04:49.610 --> 04:53.540
All right now,
where did we leave off?

04:53.580 --> 04:56.910
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it was the night of the carnival.

04:56.950 --> 05:00.080
"Noah, was there with his friends,
Fin and Sarah."

05:00.120 --> 05:03.310
- Noah?
- That's where they met...

05:03.350 --> 05:05.450
June 6th, 1940.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.790
Allie was
17 years old.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.560
- Little man wins a prize.
- Damn!

05:11.600 --> 05:13.830
- Thank you for playing.
- Ha, you're real funny.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.130
Man, I clobbered
that thing.

05:15.170 --> 05:17.130
I'm tellin' you,
these games are fixed.

05:17.170 --> 05:18.790
- Hello.
- How are you?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.770
Hi, what's your name?

05:20.800 --> 05:22.500
Step right up here.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.730
Over the hook, yeah.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.780
Whoa.

05:28.810 --> 05:31.840
- Who's this girl with Sara?
- Her name's Allie Hamilton.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.320
She's here for the summer
with her family.

05:34.350 --> 05:35.650
Dad's got more
money than God.

05:35.690 --> 05:37.780
- Hi, Fin!
- Hi, honey.

05:37.820 --> 05:40.620
Look, I won you a prize.

05:40.660 --> 05:43.990
Oh, Fin, thank you!

05:46.000 --> 05:48.400
- Oww!
- Yeah.

05:48.430 --> 05:50.190
Hey great, huh?

05:50.230 --> 05:52.060
Hey Allie, you want
some cotton candy?

05:52.100 --> 05:54.130
- Umm, okay.
- That would be so much fun.

05:55.970 --> 05:58.570
You only get
one chance, son.

05:58.610 --> 06:00.970
- You want to dance with me?
- No.

06:01.010 --> 06:04.140
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

06:04.180 --> 06:07.170
Noah, she's with us.

06:07.220 --> 06:11.120
Hey Allie, you want
to ride the Ferris wheel?

06:11.150 --> 06:12.680
- I'd love to.
- All right.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.350
Excuse me.

06:15.630 --> 06:17.180
Excuse me.

06:21.260 --> 06:24.170
- Noah Calhoun.
- What?

06:24.200 --> 06:26.960
Works down at the lumber yard
with Fin.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.160
Oh...

06:29.210 --> 06:32.170
Did you see he was standing like
two inches away from my face?

06:32.210 --> 06:34.340
Yeah, I saw.
That's Noah, though.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.600
You know I'm surprised
he even came over.

06:37.650 --> 06:38.980
I think he likes you.

06:59.100 --> 07:00.800
Hey what... jerk...

07:00.840 --> 07:04.200
Get off me.
Don't touch me.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.300
- Hey!
- Well, I... ugh!

07:06.340 --> 07:08.330
- What are you doing?
- Hey, you can't do that!

07:08.380 --> 07:10.070
I'll pay you
when I get down, Tommy.

07:10.110 --> 07:11.910
I'm Noah Calhoun.

07:11.950 --> 07:14.040
- So?!
- So, it's really nice to meet you.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.640
- Allie, who is this guy?
- I don't know, Noah Calhoun.

07:16.690 --> 07:19.120
- I would really like to take you out.
- Friend! Do you mind?

07:20.860 --> 07:23.760
You can't sit more than two people
in a chair, Noah.

07:23.790 --> 07:25.260
Okay, Tommy,
all right.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.890
Get down, Noah,
you're gonna kill yourself!

07:30.930 --> 07:32.130
Noah, cut it out.

07:32.170 --> 07:33.830
Now, will you
go out with me?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.530
What?

07:35.570 --> 07:37.510
- No.
- No?

07:37.540 --> 07:38.870
- No.
- No?

07:38.910 --> 07:40.570
Hey pal,
she just told you.

07:40.610 --> 07:41.700
Why not?

07:41.750 --> 07:43.740
I don't know,
because I don't want to.

07:43.780 --> 07:44.800
Noah!

07:44.850 --> 07:47.180
What? Well, you leave me
no other choice then.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.410
Oh my God.

07:49.450 --> 07:50.440
I'm not kidding.

07:50.490 --> 07:52.220
- Noah, stop fooling around.
- What are you doing?

07:52.260 --> 07:54.660
- Noah, grab the bar.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

07:54.690 --> 07:56.280
Will you...

07:56.330 --> 07:59.060
- or will you not go out with me?
- Noah, you best come on.

07:59.100 --> 08:02.000
- God damn, my hand's slipping.
- Then grab the bar, you idiot.

08:02.030 --> 08:04.760
- Not until she agrees.
- Ah, go on out with him, honey.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.000
- Okay, okay, fine,
I'll go out with you.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.300
- What?
- No, don't do me any favors.

08:08.340 --> 08:09.670
No, no. I want to.

08:09.710 --> 08:11.040
- You want to? You want to?
- Yes!

08:11.070 --> 08:13.040
- Say it.
- I want to go out with you.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.670
- Say it again.
- I want to go out with you.

08:15.710 --> 08:18.040
All right, all right
we'll go out.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.850
You think
you're so smart, don't you?

08:20.880 --> 08:22.550
That wasn't funny,
Noah, you idiot!

08:22.590 --> 08:26.020
No, it's okay,
I'll take care of this.

08:26.060 --> 08:27.750
What are you doing?

08:27.790 --> 08:28.780
Please don't do that.

08:28.830 --> 08:30.350
Please don't do that, Allie.

08:30.390 --> 08:32.120
I can't believe...

08:32.160 --> 08:33.790
Oh God.

08:35.630 --> 08:37.400
You're not so cocky now,
are ya?

08:37.430 --> 08:39.300
I'm gonna get you for that.

08:39.340 --> 08:41.740
Ah, maybe you will,
maybe you won't.

08:44.310 --> 08:47.610
- Did he say anything to you?
- Oh, yeah, will you look at that?

08:47.640 --> 08:49.540
It's that girl from the Carnival,
right?

08:52.150 --> 08:54.050
Do you remember me?

08:54.080 --> 08:56.570
Yeah, sure,
Mr. Underwear, was it?

08:56.620 --> 08:58.350
- Well, I...
- How could I forget.

08:58.390 --> 08:59.880
Yeah, I wanted to clear
that up with you,

08:59.920 --> 09:01.410
because
I'm really sorry about that.

09:01.460 --> 09:02.750
It was a really stupid thing
to do...

09:02.790 --> 09:04.380
crawl up a Ferris wheel
to talk to somebody.

09:04.430 --> 09:06.330
But I had
to be next to you.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.520
I was being
drawn to you.

09:11.570 --> 09:14.000
Oh... oh, jeez,
what a line!

09:14.040 --> 09:16.400
You use that
on all the girls?

09:16.440 --> 09:18.170
- No.
- Right.

09:18.210 --> 09:20.510
I saw you the other night
with little Miss Ribbons.

09:20.540 --> 09:22.200
- What are you doing tonight?
- What?

09:22.250 --> 09:24.270
Or tomorrow night,
or this weekend, whatever.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.250
- Why?
- Why? Our date.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.540
What date?

09:27.580 --> 09:29.310
- The date that you agreed to.
- No...

09:29.350 --> 09:31.550
Yes, you did.
You promised and you swore it.

09:31.590 --> 09:33.350
Well, I guess
I changed my mind.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.320
Look, I know you get some dirty guy
coming up to you

09:37.360 --> 09:38.880
on the street...
you don't know him.

09:38.930 --> 09:40.760
You don't know me,
but I know me.

09:42.430 --> 09:44.160
And when I see something
that I like,

09:44.200 --> 09:46.530
I gotta ha...
I love it.

09:46.570 --> 09:48.630
I go... I mean,
I go crazy for it.

09:48.670 --> 09:51.440
Okay, what are you
talking about?

09:51.470 --> 09:52.670
Well, you.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.540
Oh, you're good.

09:55.580 --> 09:57.210
- What?
- You're good.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.720
- No. No, you're getting me wrong.
- You're good. You are.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.270
- You're fantastic.
- I'm not.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.180
You really are.
I'm impressed.

10:03.220 --> 10:06.520
- I'm not usually like this, I'm sorry.
- Oh, yes, you are.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.650
I can be fun,
if you want...

10:08.690 --> 10:12.180
pensive, uh, smart,

10:12.230 --> 10:14.960
uh, superstitious,
brave.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.930
And uh... I can be light on my feet.

10:17.970 --> 10:20.530
I could be
whatever you want.

10:20.570 --> 10:23.300
You just tell me what you want
and I'll be that for you.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.870
You're dumb.

10:28.140 --> 10:29.510
I could be that.

10:32.420 --> 10:34.410
Come on, one date.
What's it gonna hurt?

10:34.450 --> 10:36.110
Umm...
I don't think so.

10:36.150 --> 10:37.980
Well, what I can I do
to change your mind?

10:38.020 --> 10:39.960
Guess you'll figure
something out.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.430
- You sure she's coming?
- Relax, pal, it's all set up.

10:44.460 --> 10:45.980
We're meeting her
for the late show.

10:46.030 --> 10:47.860
Look... what did
I tell you? Come on.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.940
Oh my goodness,
what a coincidence!

10:56.970 --> 10:58.700
I need to talk to you
for a second.

10:58.740 --> 11:02.510
- He's here!
- Allie, you remember Noah, don't you?

11:02.550 --> 11:03.530
- Yes, I remember.
- Yeah.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.510
- Come here.
- Fin!

11:05.550 --> 11:07.210
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.580
- It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.780
- You look great.
- Aw, thanks.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.520
Really, really great.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.250
You do look great.
You look great.

11:15.290 --> 11:18.690
And I know I look great,
so could we please go see this movie?

11:18.730 --> 11:21.490
- The show's about to start.
- After you.

11:21.530 --> 11:24.160
You come back here,
Li'I Abner.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.760
You ain't gonna catch me,
Daisy Mae!

11:26.800 --> 11:29.070
It's Sadie Hawkins Day,
I'm supposed to catch you!

11:29.110 --> 11:30.830
I'm faster than you.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.610
No, No!

11:34.640 --> 11:36.840
I'll get you!

11:38.010 --> 11:39.950
I'm going get...

11:39.980 --> 11:41.450
Here I come!

11:41.480 --> 11:43.980
You better run fast!

11:53.600 --> 11:55.590
You ketchum Polecat
far and squar.

12:01.870 --> 12:04.530
Wait for me.

12:04.570 --> 12:06.600
What happened
in that movie?

12:07.940 --> 12:10.110
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.710
- What are you guys doing?
- Want to walk with me?

12:13.750 --> 12:14.740
Yeah, what's going on?

12:14.780 --> 12:16.220
- Yeah.
- We're gonna walk.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.740
Do you guys
love each other?

12:18.790 --> 12:21.090
Huh?
Oh, I get it.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.920
- You guys do love each other.
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.050
Okay, good bye.

12:25.090 --> 12:27.590
- All right, all right.
- Mmm...

12:31.670 --> 12:33.730
That was fun.

12:33.770 --> 12:35.640
Mm-hmm.

12:35.670 --> 12:38.070
I haven't seen a movie
in ages.

12:38.110 --> 12:39.870
- Really?
- Huh-uh.

12:39.910 --> 12:42.710
Not since
I was a little kid.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.340
What?

12:44.380 --> 12:46.180
No, I, uh...

12:46.220 --> 12:48.810
I'm busy, you know,
I don't have a lot of time.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.550
- You're busy?
- Mm-hmm.

12:51.590 --> 12:55.180
I have a very
strict schedule.

12:55.220 --> 12:56.990
My days are all
planned out.

12:57.030 --> 13:01.260
I get up in the morning... breakfast,
math tutor, Latin tutor, lunch,

13:01.300 --> 13:05.030
tennis lessons, dance lessons...
sometimes both...

13:05.070 --> 13:08.900
French tutor, piano lesson,
then I eat dinner.

13:08.940 --> 13:10.930
And after dinner
I spend time with my family.

13:10.970 --> 13:13.770
And then l... I catch up
on some reading.

13:16.850 --> 13:18.280
Wow.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.250
Sounds like the road
to success.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.950
Oh, you bet.

13:22.990 --> 13:24.650
We're applying
to all these colleges...

13:24.690 --> 13:29.150
umm... Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence...
those are the ones we want.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.730
- And who's we?
- What?

13:33.760 --> 13:35.860
You just said,
"The ones that we want."

13:35.900 --> 13:37.560
Oh, Mom and Daddy.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.400
We decide
everything together.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.970
Everything?

13:43.010 --> 13:44.670
No, not everything.

13:44.710 --> 13:46.440
But the important
things, yes.

13:48.040 --> 13:51.280
And then everything else,
you get to decide all by yourself?

13:53.120 --> 13:55.980
- Don't be rude.
- I'm sorry.

13:58.550 --> 14:01.610
Just trying to figure out
what you do for fun.

14:01.660 --> 14:04.520
What do you mean?

14:04.560 --> 14:06.930
I mean...

14:06.960 --> 14:08.560
I don't know,
I mean all those things

14:08.600 --> 14:11.160
are things you
have to do, right?

14:11.200 --> 14:15.070
So what do you do
because you want to?

14:15.100 --> 14:17.230
I just told ya.

14:20.310 --> 14:21.970
I don't know.

14:22.010 --> 14:24.500
This surprises me.

14:24.550 --> 14:25.840
Why?

14:25.880 --> 14:29.340
I just always figured
you were kinda...

14:29.390 --> 14:31.180
Kinda what?

14:31.220 --> 14:32.520
Just...

14:34.560 --> 14:37.390
- Free.
- What?

14:37.430 --> 14:38.950
Free.

14:41.230 --> 14:43.760
I am free.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.560
You don't seem like it.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.570
Well, I am.

14:50.710 --> 14:52.700
Come here,
I want to show you something.

14:52.740 --> 14:56.410
- Noah, what are you doing?
- Just come on.

14:56.450 --> 14:59.880
- You're gonna get run over.
- By all the cars?

15:07.660 --> 15:09.250
My Dad and I used
to come out here

15:09.290 --> 15:13.020
and lay down and watch
the lights change.

15:13.060 --> 15:16.050
And watch them go
from green to red to yellow.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.460
You could try it,
if you wanted to.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.900
- No.
- Why not?

15:22.940 --> 15:25.700
Because I don't know...
will you just get up?

15:25.740 --> 15:28.140
That's your problem,
you know that?

15:29.480 --> 15:31.000
You don't do
what you want.

15:39.420 --> 15:40.950
Okay.

15:58.170 --> 16:00.140
What happens
if a car comes?

16:00.180 --> 16:01.870
- We die.
- What?

16:01.910 --> 16:03.850
Just relax.
Just trust.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.310
You need to learn
how to trust.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.480
Okay.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.280
- Painting.
- Hmm?

16:14.320 --> 16:16.880
You asked me
what I do for me.

16:16.930 --> 16:20.660
- What now?
- I love to paint.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.890
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

16:23.930 --> 16:25.990
Huh.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.970
Most of the time, I have all these
thoughts bouncing around in my head.

16:30.010 --> 16:33.310
But with a brush
in my hand,

16:33.340 --> 16:36.110
the world just gets
kinda quiet.

16:44.190 --> 16:45.850
Get out of the street!

16:54.700 --> 16:55.720
Are you okay?

16:58.430 --> 17:00.530
Why are you laughing?

17:03.840 --> 17:06.270
Oh, that was fun.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.380
Do you want
to dance with me?

17:14.080 --> 17:15.110
Sure.

17:18.090 --> 17:19.650
- Now?
- Mm-hmm.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.320
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.950
Not supposed to dance
in the middle of the street.

17:23.990 --> 17:27.090
Who said dance
in the street?

17:27.130 --> 17:28.760
And we don't
have any music.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.270
Well,
we'll make some.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.640
# Bum bum #

17:42.680 --> 17:44.340
# Bum bum bum #

17:44.380 --> 17:46.250
# Bum #

17:46.280 --> 17:48.410
# Bum bum #

17:48.450 --> 17:50.510
# Bum bum bum
bum bum. #

17:50.550 --> 17:52.520
You're a terrible singer.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.150
I know.

17:55.830 --> 17:57.590
But I like this song.

17:57.630 --> 18:04.400
# I'll be seeing you #

18:04.430 --> 18:07.630
# In all the old #

18:07.670 --> 18:11.000
# Familiar places #

18:12.540 --> 18:16.270
# That this heart
of mine #

18:16.310 --> 18:20.080
# Embraces #

18:20.120 --> 18:23.140
# All day
and through #

18:27.320 --> 18:35.160
# In that small cafe #

18:35.200 --> 18:43.070
# The park
across the way #

18:43.110 --> 18:49.510
# The children's
carousel #

18:49.550 --> 18:51.910
- # The chestnut trees... #
- Southern summers

18:51.950 --> 18:54.180
are indifferent
to the trials of young love.

18:54.220 --> 18:57.010
- # The wishing well #
- Armed with warnings and doubts,

18:57.050 --> 19:01.610
Noah and Allie gave a remarkably
convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl

19:01.660 --> 19:04.390
traveling down
a very long road

19:04.430 --> 19:06.620
with no regard
for the consequences.

19:06.660 --> 19:08.360
They fell in love,
didn't they?

19:08.400 --> 19:10.420
- Yes, they did.
- Good.

19:10.470 --> 19:13.130
I like this kind
of story. Go on.

19:18.610 --> 19:20.070
After that night,

19:20.110 --> 19:23.310
Allie and Noah spent
every waking hour together.

19:23.350 --> 19:26.040
And soon
they were inseparable.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.950
- Noah, come on.
- Your boat cannot beat me there.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.290
- That's really nice.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm...

19:51.470 --> 19:53.310
"Beautiful dripping fragments.

19:53.340 --> 19:55.040
The negligent list

19:55.080 --> 19:57.270
of one after another,

19:57.310 --> 19:59.680
as I happen to call
them to me.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.580
Or drink to them.

20:01.620 --> 20:03.710
The real poems,
what we call poems,

20:03.750 --> 20:07.090
being merely pictures.
The poems of the privacy of the night.

20:07.120 --> 20:10.090
And of men like me.

20:10.130 --> 20:12.360
This poem,
drooping shy and unseen,

20:12.390 --> 20:15.590
that I always carry.
And that all men carry."

20:15.630 --> 20:17.860
Not bad for Whitman.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.560
Hey, look,
we got a visitor.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.440
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

20:23.470 --> 20:26.370
Well, don't apologize,
come on up here, darling.

20:26.410 --> 20:29.640
We could use a little something here
besides the smell of lumber.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.810
Dad,
this is Allison Hamilton.

20:32.850 --> 20:34.370
Allison,
I'm glad to meet you.

20:34.420 --> 20:35.610
- Allie.
- Allie.

20:35.650 --> 20:37.080
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Calhoun.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.350
Well Mr. Calho...
What, am I old or something?

20:39.390 --> 20:40.980
You can call me Frank.

20:41.020 --> 20:43.050
- Here, come in and have a seat.
- Okay.

20:44.230 --> 20:46.820
So, Allie.
Well, yeah, she is pretty, son.

20:46.860 --> 20:49.560
- Yes.
- She's a lot prettier than you let on.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.570
- Oh, is that right?
- No, it's not right.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.830
Don't believe what he says.

20:52.870 --> 20:55.460
- What is this you got?
- Umm, l... uh, I just...

20:55.500 --> 20:56.800
I brought you something.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.900
Let me see.
Let's have a look.

20:59.940 --> 21:01.970
- Did you do this?
- Mm-hmm.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.810
Well, that's beautiful.
Look at that.

21:03.850 --> 21:05.510
That's a damn picture there.

21:06.980 --> 21:09.750
Well, I know just where we can
put that, thank you.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.380
Oh, that was
a lovely poem.

21:12.420 --> 21:13.980
What was it?

21:14.020 --> 21:15.620
- El...
- Whitman.

21:15.660 --> 21:19.190
See when he was a little kid
he used to stutter real bad.

21:19.230 --> 21:21.790
- Dad...
- So... well, you did.

21:21.830 --> 21:23.890
- I didn't know that.
- God. I stammered.

21:23.930 --> 21:25.370
Stammered, stutter,
what's the difference?

21:25.400 --> 21:28.170
Couldn't understand
a damn thing he said.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.500
So, I got him to read me poetry
out loud.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.010
It wasn't
very pretty at first,

21:33.040 --> 21:34.300
but then his stutter
went away.

21:34.340 --> 21:36.240
Well, it's a good idea,
that poetry.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.800
- Yeah, I thought so.
- Huh?

21:37.850 --> 21:40.610
Unbelievable,
unbelievable.

21:40.650 --> 21:43.120
I'm a Tennyson man,
myself, but he likes Whitman...

21:43.150 --> 21:45.020
For some reason,
I don't know.

21:45.050 --> 21:47.580
Say, how would you like some breakfast?
Would you like some breakfast?

21:47.620 --> 21:49.110
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.560
- Dad, it's 10:00.
- What's that got to do with it?

21:51.590 --> 21:53.890
You can have pancakes
any damn time of night you want.

21:53.930 --> 21:56.830
- Come on, you want some breakfast?
- Sure.

21:58.170 --> 22:01.330
It was an improbable romance.

22:01.370 --> 22:05.200
He was a country boy.
She was from the city.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.970
She had the world
at her feet,

22:07.010 --> 22:09.200
while he didn't have
two dimes to rub together.

22:14.050 --> 22:15.570
Noah, come on.

22:16.690 --> 22:17.740
Whoo!

22:18.750 --> 22:19.980
Look at us.

22:22.630 --> 22:23.890
What are we doing?

22:23.930 --> 22:26.790
Do you think in another life,
I could have been a bird?

22:28.860 --> 22:29.990
What do you mean?

22:30.030 --> 22:32.160
Like reincarnation.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.070
I don't know.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.660
I think I could.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.310
Say I'm a bird.

22:45.450 --> 22:46.970
No.

22:47.020 --> 22:49.040
- Don't do it.
- Say I'm a bird.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.050
- Stop it. Stop it now.

22:51.090 --> 22:52.850
- You're not.
- Say it!

22:54.820 --> 22:57.380
- You're a bird.
- Yeah.

23:03.070 --> 23:04.930
Now say
you're a bird too.

23:07.670 --> 23:09.830
If you're a bird,
I'm a bird.

23:43.370 --> 23:45.530
- Come on, darling.
- What are you doing?

23:45.570 --> 23:47.270
Don't.
Don't!

23:57.320 --> 23:58.950
Here we go,
on the count of three, okay?

23:58.990 --> 24:01.480
Real easy,
on three, ready?

24:01.520 --> 24:03.080
- Okay, okay.
- One...

24:03.130 --> 24:05.390
- Two... two...
- two...

24:05.430 --> 24:06.990
...three!
- No! I can't.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.220
Get in the water!

24:09.260 --> 24:11.430
- Get in! I'm sorry.
- Come on, chicken.

24:11.470 --> 24:13.400
Get in the water, baby.
Baby, would you get in.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.430
- Get in the water.
- I can't.

24:15.470 --> 24:16.940
- Go!
- Get in the water!

24:16.970 --> 24:18.270
- One...
- Come on, jump.

24:18.310 --> 24:20.370
- Two...
- Three.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.580
Keep 'em together!
No, no, no.

24:33.620 --> 24:35.520
- Get to your place.
- Down here.

24:35.560 --> 24:38.030
And move.
And keep it.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.050
No, don't move it!

24:39.090 --> 24:40.960
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.460
They didn't agree on much.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.300
In fact, they rarely agreed on
everything. They fought all the time.

24:46.340 --> 24:47.930
- Don't kick me!
- Don't push me.

24:47.970 --> 24:50.370
And they challenged
each other every day.

24:50.410 --> 24:52.460
But despite
their differences,

24:52.510 --> 24:55.440
they had one
important thing in common.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.110
They were crazy
about each other.

25:00.180 --> 25:01.510
Okay,
I have to go.

25:01.550 --> 25:03.610
- No.
- Yes, I do.

25:17.300 --> 25:18.660
Allie.

25:18.700 --> 25:22.000
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy you're...

25:22.040 --> 25:23.060
I didn't see you there.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.030
You kinda scared me.

25:29.380 --> 25:31.350
Becoming friendly
with that boy down there.

25:34.050 --> 25:35.180
Yes.

25:36.490 --> 25:38.080
Bring him
to the house on Sunday.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.090
I want to meet
this young man.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.890
Okay.

25:42.930 --> 25:44.090
Good night, Daddy.

25:44.130 --> 25:46.120
Good night.

25:52.940 --> 25:54.100
Oh, boy.

25:54.140 --> 25:55.900
This bug goes
"Daddy, I don't understand."

25:55.940 --> 26:00.380
He goes, "Well, in theory,
we're both millionaires, but in reality,

26:00.410 --> 26:01.930
we live with
a bunch of whores."

26:06.420 --> 26:07.970
Bishop Stevens
told me that.

26:08.020 --> 26:11.610
Olivier, please remove the... the liquor
decanter from in front of my husband.

26:11.650 --> 26:13.050
I think he's had
a little too much to drink.

26:13.090 --> 26:15.750
- I don't get it.
- Pay attention.

26:15.790 --> 26:18.350
So, what do
you do, Noah?

26:18.390 --> 26:21.260
I work at the lumber yard
with Fin.

26:21.300 --> 26:25.430
Mainly milling and receiving logs...
and stripping the bark.

26:25.470 --> 26:26.960
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.700
Thank you.

26:28.740 --> 26:31.260
If you don't mind my asking, uh,
how much do you make at your job?

26:31.310 --> 26:33.100
Uh, how much money
do I make?

26:33.140 --> 26:35.040
Mm-hmm.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.640
About 40 cents an hour.

26:40.320 --> 26:43.250
Yeah, it's not much,
but I don't need a lot.

26:43.290 --> 26:45.410
And l...
I save most of it.

26:47.220 --> 26:48.750
Let's eat. Shall we?

26:48.790 --> 26:51.920
Yes! Oh,
it looks delicious.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.660
So Noah, you and Allie have been
spending a lot of time together.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.740
You must be very fond
of each other.

27:03.570 --> 27:05.900
It's getting
pretty serious, huh?

27:05.940 --> 27:07.670
Yes, ma'am.

27:07.710 --> 27:11.940
Well, summer's almost gone.
What will you do?

27:11.980 --> 27:14.610
You know, Charleston's
only a couple of hours away.

27:16.790 --> 27:18.780
But Allie's going
to Sarah Lawrence.

27:20.690 --> 27:22.250
Didn't she tell you?

27:22.290 --> 27:24.420
No, she didn't
tell me that.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.990
I just got the letter.
I was going to tell you.

27:29.030 --> 27:30.060
It's okay.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.260
And Sarah Lawrence
is in New York.

27:37.810 --> 27:39.000
I didn't know that.

27:40.340 --> 27:43.780
Anne, this conversation's
too stuffy for the dinner table.

27:43.810 --> 27:47.150
Let the children have fun without
bringing in the Spanish Inquisition.

27:47.180 --> 27:49.340
My lips are buttoned,
right now.

27:49.380 --> 27:52.910
I do know another joke about the Nun
and the full standing bishop.

27:54.260 --> 27:55.250
- Stop
- That wasn't me.

27:55.290 --> 27:57.420
I'm leaving the table
if you tell another joke.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.460
Whoo!

28:01.500 --> 28:02.760
I'm gonna do it.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.790
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:10.510 --> 28:13.740
That child's got too much spirit for
a girl of her circumstance.

28:13.780 --> 28:16.800
Nah, it's just
summer love.

28:16.850 --> 28:18.440
Trouble
is what it is.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.350
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

28:43.370 --> 28:45.100
Is that Allie
out there?

28:46.810 --> 28:49.610
Do you want
to go somewhere?

28:51.910 --> 28:52.940
Okay.

28:58.390 --> 28:59.680
Wait here.

29:20.340 --> 29:21.710
Allie!

29:23.650 --> 29:24.870
Come on.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.950
All right,
take a step.

29:30.990 --> 29:33.390
Step. No, don't...

29:34.960 --> 29:36.720
All right,
just stay there.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.920
Don't open
your eyes.

29:45.630 --> 29:47.500
Okay.

29:47.540 --> 29:49.770
The Windsor Plantation.

29:49.810 --> 29:52.330
It was built in 1772.

29:52.370 --> 29:54.670
- Rumor has it that Francis Marion...
- Mm-hmm?

29:54.710 --> 29:57.840
proposed to his wife right here under
these... uh, these steps.

29:59.010 --> 30:00.500
- Huh?
- Watch out.

30:00.550 --> 30:02.610
You be careful, these are broken.
Look at that.

30:02.650 --> 30:04.620
This...

30:04.650 --> 30:06.420
This place is gigantic.

30:06.460 --> 30:08.620
Yeah, a gigantic
piece of crap.

30:08.660 --> 30:11.130
It is.

30:11.160 --> 30:14.320
But I'm gonna buy it one day
and I'm gonna fix it up.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.130
All it needs
is a new floor.

30:17.300 --> 30:19.030
And new walls
and a roof.

30:19.070 --> 30:22.130
- Is that all?
- And plumbing and electric.

30:22.170 --> 30:24.640
- And furniture.
- Yes, and furniture.

30:24.670 --> 30:26.270
But it's right
on the water.

30:26.310 --> 30:28.110
And there's a big
old barn out there...

30:28.140 --> 30:30.300
I could turn that
into my workshop.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.440
Well, what about me?

30:32.480 --> 30:33.970
Now don't I get
any say in this?

30:36.320 --> 30:38.050
You want a say in this?

30:38.090 --> 30:40.880
Yes, I would.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.250
What do you want?

30:42.290 --> 30:43.550
I want
a white house...

30:43.590 --> 30:46.250
- with blue shutters...
- Mm-hmm.

30:46.290 --> 30:48.960
and a room overlooking
the river so I can paint.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.490
- Anything else?
- Yes.

30:51.530 --> 30:55.440
I want a big old porch that
wraps around the entire house.

30:55.470 --> 30:57.170
- We can drink tea...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

30:57.210 --> 30:58.930
and watch
the sun go down.

31:00.810 --> 31:03.070
- Okay.
- You promise?

31:03.110 --> 31:05.580
Mm-hmm,
I promise.

31:05.610 --> 31:06.950
Good.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.750
- Where are you going?
- In here.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.780
Wow.

32:00.670 --> 32:04.160
I can't play chopsticks
if you're doing that.

32:23.060 --> 32:25.460
Oh, God.

32:25.490 --> 32:27.390
Oh, make love to me.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.240
- Noah.
- Yeah?

34:23.280 --> 34:25.840
Um...

34:25.880 --> 34:28.250
I know I said that I wanted you
to make love to me,

34:28.280 --> 34:29.480
- but I think you...
- Yeah?

34:29.520 --> 34:31.710
you're gonna have
to talk me through this.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.450
- Right. You all right?
- Yeah.

34:36.490 --> 34:38.220
- Did I hurt you?
- No, no.

34:38.260 --> 34:41.090
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of thoughts.

34:41.130 --> 34:44.430
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of...

34:44.470 --> 34:45.560
never mind.

34:52.010 --> 34:54.980
Like what are you thinking?
What are you thinking, right now?

34:55.010 --> 34:56.840
You know,
right this second?

34:57.850 --> 34:58.900
Uh.

34:58.950 --> 35:02.470
Did you know that this was going
to happen when you brought me here?

35:02.520 --> 35:03.750
- No.
- No?

35:03.790 --> 35:07.240
- No.
- No, you didn't think about it?

35:07.290 --> 35:09.590
- Of course I thought about it.
- You did?

35:09.620 --> 35:12.350
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what did you think?

35:12.390 --> 35:14.520
Uh, I'm talking
too much, aren't I?

35:14.560 --> 35:17.290
Okay, okay,
I'm just going to shut up.

35:17.330 --> 35:18.820
Mum's the word.

35:18.870 --> 35:21.300
Okay.

35:21.340 --> 35:24.310
- You all right?
- Yeah.

35:24.340 --> 35:26.740
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

35:26.780 --> 35:30.370
I just don't understand
how come you're so quiet.

35:30.410 --> 35:32.970
You don't have
one thought?

35:33.010 --> 35:34.410
I'm going crazy
over here,

35:34.450 --> 35:36.850
but no, with you,
everything's fine.

35:36.890 --> 35:38.790
You don't have
a care in the world?

35:46.760 --> 35:48.630
I'm sorry.

35:48.660 --> 35:51.390
I wanted this
to be so perfect.

35:51.430 --> 35:53.560
Now I can't shut up.

35:56.370 --> 35:57.840
I love you.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.900
Did you know that?

36:16.720 --> 36:18.210
I love you too.

36:26.770 --> 36:27.890
Yeah.

36:34.040 --> 36:37.710
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

36:37.750 --> 36:41.080
No, no, I want to,
I do.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.020
Noah!
Noah!

36:44.050 --> 36:46.710
What? Fin,
get out of here!

36:46.750 --> 36:49.150
Look, I'm sorry,
but Allie's parents are going crazy.

36:49.190 --> 36:51.090
They got every cop in town
out looking for her.

37:04.170 --> 37:06.700
- You sent the police for me?
- Yes.

37:06.740 --> 37:09.010
It is two in the morning.
We sent the police.

37:09.040 --> 37:12.240
Thank God you're all right.
Where you been?

37:12.280 --> 37:14.310
Mr. Hamilton,
all this is my fault.

37:14.350 --> 37:16.280
Would you give us
a moment please?

37:16.320 --> 37:19.220
I'd like to talk
to my daughter.

37:19.250 --> 37:21.020
Alone, young lady.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.960
Thanks for everything,
Lieutenant.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.090
You bet, John, anytime.

37:32.130 --> 37:34.620
You go straight home now,
it's late.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.870
Sir, it's really
not her fault.

37:42.910 --> 37:45.210
I lost track
of time.

37:46.210 --> 37:48.550
Sit down.

37:58.190 --> 37:59.780
I'm sorry, Daddy.

38:03.700 --> 38:06.600
- Is he a rapist?
- No.

38:12.040 --> 38:16.270
- Like what, mother?
- You are going to stop seeing Noah.

38:16.310 --> 38:19.080
She is out fooling around
with that boy till 2:00 in the morning

38:19.110 --> 38:21.410
and it has got
to stop.

38:21.450 --> 38:23.210
I didn't spend
17 years of my life

38:23.250 --> 38:26.520
raising a daughter
and giving her everything...

38:26.550 --> 38:28.390
so she could throw it away
on a summer romance.

38:28.420 --> 38:29.410
Daddy, come on!

38:29.460 --> 38:31.430
She will wind up with her
heart broken or pregnant.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.150
- Anne, please.
- Now, he is a nice boy.

38:33.190 --> 38:37.130
- He's a nice boy, but he's...
- He's what? He's what? Tell me.

38:37.170 --> 38:39.360
He is trash, trash, trash...
not for you.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.600
Trash?

38:51.010 --> 38:52.640
Don't touch me!

38:54.350 --> 38:57.110
Now that is enough. You are not to see
him anymore. And that's final.

38:57.150 --> 38:58.620
- No, it's not final.
- Yes it is.

38:58.650 --> 39:00.140
- No, it's not final!
- Allie!

39:00.190 --> 39:02.590
You're not going to tell me
who I'm gonna love.

39:02.620 --> 39:06.290
- Love?
- Yes Daddy, I love him.

39:06.330 --> 39:09.020
I love him.

39:09.060 --> 39:11.050
He's not suitable
for you, baby.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.710
I love him.

39:25.750 --> 39:28.180
You are 17 years old,
you don't know anything about love.

39:28.220 --> 39:30.180
Oh, and you do?

39:30.220 --> 39:32.480
You don't look at Daddy
the way I look at Noah.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.420
You don't touch
or laugh.

39:34.460 --> 39:37.620
You don't play.
You don't know anything about love.

39:38.630 --> 39:40.560
Noah?

39:40.600 --> 39:42.060
Noah?

39:44.400 --> 39:46.730
Hey, hey.

39:46.770 --> 39:48.430
You leaving?

39:50.670 --> 39:53.510
Oh my God,
I'm so sorry.

39:53.540 --> 39:57.030
I don't even know what to say.
I'm humiliated.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.140
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

39:59.180 --> 40:01.270
- Yeah.
- No, it's not.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.910
Shh...

40:08.620 --> 40:11.020
No.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.900
- I'm gonna go.
- No, I don't want you to go.

40:18.930 --> 40:21.130
I got to think
about some stuff.

40:21.170 --> 40:23.660
What do you
got to think about, huh?

40:23.710 --> 40:25.610
Come here
and talk to me.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.200
Talk to me!

40:27.240 --> 40:29.210
About what?
You want...

40:29.240 --> 40:31.010
you're going away!

40:32.650 --> 40:34.810
You're leaving.

40:34.850 --> 40:37.480
And I'm staying here.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.180
And I'm so happy
that you're doing it,

40:40.220 --> 40:42.620
but you're gonna have
a million things to do.

40:42.660 --> 40:44.350
- No.
- You got so much ahead of you.

40:44.390 --> 40:46.330
- Don't talk like that.
- It's true.

40:46.360 --> 40:50.190
I'm not going to have
nice things, fancy things.

40:50.230 --> 40:52.720
It doesn't...

40:52.770 --> 40:55.290
It's never gonna happen for me.
It's not in the cards for me.

40:55.340 --> 40:57.170
I don't have
to go to school, okay?

40:57.210 --> 40:58.830
- Yes, you do.
- I can stay here.

40:58.870 --> 41:01.340
No. Do you see, that's exactly
what I am talking about.

41:01.380 --> 41:02.710
Then you can
come with me.

41:04.010 --> 41:06.170
- To New York?
- Yes.

41:08.050 --> 41:09.810
What am I going
to do in New York?

41:12.320 --> 41:13.790
Be with me?

41:18.890 --> 41:20.590
Yeah.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.990
I don't know.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.360
We don't got to figure all this
out tonight, ya know?

41:32.410 --> 41:34.970
We'll finish out the summer and we'll
see what happens.

41:36.310 --> 41:38.140
You saying you want
to break it off?

41:38.180 --> 41:41.050
What I'm saying we see how it goes
later on.

41:47.460 --> 41:49.980
Are you breaking up
with me?

41:52.630 --> 41:54.560
I don't see
how it's gonna work.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.530
I see...

42:00.100 --> 42:02.470
Please don't do this.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.970
You don't mean it.

42:05.310 --> 42:07.600
Oh hell, well if you're
going to do it,

42:07.640 --> 42:09.670
why wait until
the summer ends, huh?

42:09.710 --> 42:11.940
Why don't you
just do it, right now?

42:11.980 --> 42:13.670
Huh?

42:13.710 --> 42:14.980
Come on.

42:15.020 --> 42:16.350
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

42:16.380 --> 42:18.440
Do it!
Do it!

42:18.490 --> 42:20.150
Do it right now.

42:20.190 --> 42:22.920
Do it!

42:22.960 --> 42:24.080
Stop it!

42:24.130 --> 42:25.350
Oh!

42:25.390 --> 42:28.090
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
It's over.

42:28.130 --> 42:30.100
Okay? It's over.

42:30.130 --> 42:32.620
- Come here.
- Don't touch me.

42:32.670 --> 42:34.660
I hate you,
I hate you.

42:34.700 --> 42:35.960
I'm gonna go.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.490
Why don't you, why don't you
just go. Get out.

42:38.540 --> 42:42.240
Leave!
Go! Go!

42:44.050 --> 42:46.740
No, no, just wait a minute. We're not
really breaking up, are we?

42:46.780 --> 42:47.840
Come on.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.410
This is just a fight
we're having,

42:49.450 --> 42:52.510
and tomorrow it will be
like it never happened, right?

42:58.130 --> 43:00.690
- Going?
- Gone.

43:00.730 --> 43:02.530
Well, she must have
been devastated.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.890
She was.

43:03.930 --> 43:05.800
He was only trying
to do the right thing.

43:05.830 --> 43:07.320
Yeah.

43:07.370 --> 43:09.170
But what he really should have done

43:09.200 --> 43:11.000
is just told those parents
to go to hell.

43:11.040 --> 43:12.870
Just stick it
where the sun don't shine.

43:12.910 --> 43:16.000
Yeah, you're right,
probably should have.

43:17.650 --> 43:19.940
The next day,
Allie woke up

43:19.980 --> 43:22.510
to find her world
completely changed.

43:29.890 --> 43:31.830
What's going on?

43:31.860 --> 43:33.620
We're going home.

43:34.730 --> 43:36.220
- We're going now?
- Mm-hmm.

43:36.260 --> 43:38.730
No, we're not supposed to be leaving
for another week.

43:38.770 --> 43:41.460
Get dressed and then come and have
some breakfast, dear.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.990
Willow will pack
your things.

43:43.040 --> 43:45.100
Why, I'd be happy to pack your things,
Miss Allie.

43:45.140 --> 43:46.440
I don't want
you to pack my things.

43:46.470 --> 43:48.600
I don't want you to touch my stuff.
I'm not going.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.110
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

43:50.140 --> 43:52.310
- Yes, Allie, you are.
- No, I'm not.

43:52.350 --> 43:55.010
Allie, you are going whether
you like it or not.

43:55.050 --> 43:57.780
Now, even if Aaron
has to throw you over his shoulder

43:57.820 --> 44:01.550
and drag you the whole way,
you're going.

44:05.830 --> 44:06.990
Excuse me.

44:07.030 --> 44:08.290
- All right, let's go.
- Come on.

44:08.330 --> 44:10.020
We have to have all these
done by lunch.

44:10.060 --> 44:11.050
Come on, get on!

44:11.100 --> 44:12.690
You shouldn't be standing around.
Here we go.

44:12.730 --> 44:13.720
Let's go.
Come on.

44:13.770 --> 44:15.700
Fin!

44:20.270 --> 44:21.400
Where's Noah?

44:21.440 --> 44:23.170
He's out
delivering a load.

44:23.210 --> 44:26.980
- What's going on?
- I'm leaving town.

44:27.010 --> 44:28.570
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

44:28.620 --> 44:31.110
- When?
- Now, right now... like today.

44:33.290 --> 44:35.220
Look, I need you to tell Noah
something, okay?

44:35.260 --> 44:36.990
I need you
to tell him that I love him.

44:37.020 --> 44:39.550
And tell him
that I'm sorry for everything, okay?

44:41.060 --> 44:44.190
Look, I was up all night
with him, Allie.

44:44.230 --> 44:45.760
I've never seen him
so low.

44:45.800 --> 44:49.000
It's over. Don't make it any harder
than it already is.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.900
No! No, it's not over.

44:50.940 --> 44:52.740
Fin, we had a fight
last night.

44:52.770 --> 44:55.370
No, we said some things we didn't mean,
but it's not over.

44:55.410 --> 44:56.810
- It is over.
- No.

44:56.840 --> 44:58.470
Leave it alone.
Let it go.

44:58.510 --> 45:00.880
I'm coming.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.110
Mama, I'm coming!

45:05.520 --> 45:08.980
- Look, he understands.
- But...

45:09.020 --> 45:11.390
It's hard,
but he really does.

45:11.430 --> 45:14.220
Summer's over
and it's time to go home.

45:14.260 --> 45:16.590
If he wants to talk to you,
he'll write. If not?

45:22.140 --> 45:24.300
Okay.

45:24.340 --> 45:27.640
Okay, can you just... can you just
tell him that I love him, then?

45:27.680 --> 45:30.700
- Can you do that?
- I'll tell him.

45:32.010 --> 45:33.570
Thank you.

45:35.850 --> 45:37.440
Bye, Fin.

46:19.490 --> 46:20.860
She's gone.

46:35.880 --> 46:39.110
Summer romances end
for all kinds of reasons.

46:40.310 --> 46:42.310
But when all
is said and done,

46:42.350 --> 46:44.180
they have
one thing in common:

46:44.220 --> 46:47.240
They are shooting stars...

46:47.290 --> 46:50.350
a spectacular moment
of light in the heavens,

46:50.390 --> 46:52.120
a fleeting glimpse
of eternity.

46:52.160 --> 46:56.390
And in a flash,
they're gone.

46:58.030 --> 46:59.730
Noah was desperate.

46:59.770 --> 47:01.930
He wrote to Allie
that he was sorry and stupid

47:01.970 --> 47:03.900
for breaking up
with her.

47:03.940 --> 47:07.700
He wrote to tell her that he still loved
her, and he wanted to see her.

47:07.740 --> 47:11.840
And that if she would write back,
he would come to wherever she was.

47:14.750 --> 47:17.580
He wrote one letter
a day for a year...

47:17.620 --> 47:20.050
365 letters,

47:20.090 --> 47:21.820
but they all
went unanswered.

47:21.860 --> 47:24.620
Hey Fred!
Nothing?

47:24.660 --> 47:25.960
Sorry.

47:25.990 --> 47:28.720
All right,
thank you.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.750
Finally, after a year
of silence,

47:30.800 --> 47:34.930
he decided to put it all behind him
and start a new life.

47:34.970 --> 47:36.900
So he wrote
a farewell letter

47:36.940 --> 47:39.530
And he and Fin
packed their bags

47:39.570 --> 47:41.400
and headed for Atlanta.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.340
Noah! Noah!

47:43.380 --> 47:45.240
Noah!

47:46.350 --> 47:48.140
Come on,
listen to this!

47:48.180 --> 47:53.950
A state of war has existed

47:53.990 --> 47:56.920
between
the United States and the...

47:56.960 --> 47:58.720
The Constitution
of the United States,

47:58.760 --> 48:02.090
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

48:02.130 --> 48:05.160
Noah and Fin
enlisted together.

48:05.200 --> 48:07.190
And after two years
of chasing Rommel

48:07.230 --> 48:09.030
through
the North African desert,

48:09.070 --> 48:12.630
they were deployed
to Patton's Third Army in Europe.

48:22.120 --> 48:23.240
Go!

48:28.660 --> 48:30.120
Fin!

48:54.250 --> 48:56.180
Do I contradict myself?

48:56.220 --> 48:58.380
Very well then,
I contradict myself.

48:58.420 --> 49:00.610
Allie was in her
third year of college

49:00.650 --> 49:03.710
when she volunteered
as a nurse's aid.

49:03.760 --> 49:06.520
To her, the broken men
with shattered bodies,

49:06.560 --> 49:09.620
who filled the ward
were all Noah.

49:09.660 --> 49:12.690
Or someone who fought
beside him in the jungle

49:12.730 --> 49:15.500
or frozen
snow swept road.

49:15.540 --> 49:16.940
I'm gonna lift you up.

49:16.970 --> 49:18.500
Ready?

49:18.540 --> 49:21.740
There we go.

49:21.780 --> 49:25.180
Now, I'm gonna bring
this leg over.

49:25.210 --> 49:26.370
- Set it on the stool.
- All right.

49:26.410 --> 49:29.010
- You okay?
- Yeah.

49:29.050 --> 49:32.380
Miss, can I
ask you a question?

49:32.420 --> 49:34.390
Hmm?

49:34.420 --> 49:36.250
I noticed that you
aren't wearing a ring.

49:36.290 --> 49:40.620
And I was wondering
if I could take you out.

49:42.130 --> 49:44.530
- Excuse me?
- On a date.

49:47.570 --> 49:50.440
Now, before you go
and say no,

49:50.470 --> 49:53.910
I'll have you know that
I am an excellent dancer

49:53.940 --> 49:56.930
and my intentions
are completely dishonorable.

50:01.480 --> 50:04.780
Okay, okay
"Casanova," come on.

50:04.820 --> 50:06.910
Let's just
get you better,

50:06.950 --> 50:09.180
then we'll talk
about a date, okay?

50:18.930 --> 50:20.920
Would you get
a load of him?

50:23.700 --> 50:26.260
Oh my gosh,
he is dreamy.

50:27.270 --> 50:29.330
- What is he doing here?
- Mmm.

50:29.380 --> 50:30.780
He's staring at you.

50:30.810 --> 50:32.210
Oh, miss?

50:34.480 --> 50:36.420
I'm all better.

50:37.520 --> 50:40.150
Now, how's
about that date?

50:40.190 --> 50:42.280
Allie was surprised
how quickly

50:42.320 --> 50:44.660
she fell in love
with Lon Hammond.

50:49.460 --> 50:51.090
He was handsome, smart,

50:51.130 --> 50:53.960
funny, sophisticated
and charming.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.090
Hey!

51:02.610 --> 51:05.100
He also came from
old Southern money,

51:05.150 --> 51:06.940
and was
fabulously wealthy.

51:11.690 --> 51:15.090
What?

51:19.060 --> 51:20.050
# Hya! #

51:22.230 --> 51:23.750
Oh, what's happening?

51:23.800 --> 51:25.290
- Where you going?
- Where they going?

51:25.330 --> 51:27.960
- See you later, sweetheart.
- Oh dear, look at that.

51:30.500 --> 51:33.230
Allie, I've been thinking a lot about
why we shouldn't get married.

51:33.270 --> 51:35.900
Okay, I give up,
why shouldn't we get married?

51:35.940 --> 51:38.430
Well see, that's the thing,
I couldn't think of anything at first.

51:38.480 --> 51:41.280
An then, it just dawned on me.
Your parents...

51:41.320 --> 51:43.150
- My parents?
- Absolutely.

51:43.180 --> 51:45.120
- Your old mom and dad.
Thank you for that.

51:45.150 --> 51:46.480
Mom?

51:46.520 --> 51:48.080
You see, the problem is
that they love me.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.680
- I'm exactly the type of man
- They do.

51:49.720 --> 51:51.450
- they want you to end up with.
- Really?

51:51.490 --> 51:55.050
You know, I'm wealthy,
I'm from the South, I got a decent job.

51:55.100 --> 51:58.390
You know, I'm an incredible dancer,
I'm a really smart guy.

51:58.430 --> 52:00.900
You look great.

52:00.930 --> 52:03.400
- I like to think...
- So what's the problem, huh?

52:03.440 --> 52:05.930
- Now just this, if you marry me...
- Mm-hmm.

52:05.970 --> 52:07.630
- Now listen close.

52:07.670 --> 52:09.440
- If you marry me...
- Mm-hmm.

52:09.480 --> 52:12.780
then you will have lost a life long
battle of defiance against them.

52:12.810 --> 52:14.510
Oh my goodness,
what are we going to do?

52:14.550 --> 52:15.780
- I do not know.
- Huh!

52:15.820 --> 52:18.750
Hey, band,
you feeling all right?

52:18.790 --> 52:20.980
# Hey, band,
you feeling all right?! #

52:21.020 --> 52:22.990
# Ooh bop sha bam,
shi bimmy bop #

52:23.020 --> 52:25.460
- # Oh bop sha bam, shi bimmy bop #
- You say it!

52:25.490 --> 52:27.960
- # Ally ally ally ooh #
- # Ally ally ally ooh #

52:28.000 --> 52:29.930
- # Olly olly olly ooh #
- # Olly olly olly ooh #

52:29.960 --> 52:31.360
- # Whooly ooh #
- # Whooly ooh #

52:31.400 --> 52:33.800
- # Whooly ooh #
- # Whooly ooh #

52:35.700 --> 52:39.000
See Allie, I think...
damn it, I think you have to marry me.

52:39.040 --> 52:41.100
- I think you need to marry me.
- I do?

52:41.140 --> 52:42.340
- Yes you do.
- I do, why?

52:42.380 --> 52:44.640
Because if you do,
you parents will always know

52:44.680 --> 52:48.270
the unhappiness that you feel for
not being able to disappoint them.

52:48.320 --> 52:51.110
I think you may
have overlooked one minor detail.

52:51.150 --> 52:52.310
And what's that?

52:52.350 --> 52:55.190
Well, you see you have to
get their permission first.

52:55.220 --> 52:58.120
And I think you may have overestimated
their affection for you.

52:58.160 --> 52:59.630
Is that right?

52:59.660 --> 53:02.150
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I don't think so.

53:02.200 --> 53:03.190
Then why not?

53:03.230 --> 53:05.630
Oh, 'cause I asked them
already and they said yes.

53:05.670 --> 53:07.460
What?

53:11.040 --> 53:12.670
One more thing.

53:14.340 --> 53:16.330
I love you.

53:16.380 --> 53:18.640
Will you marry me, honey?

53:18.680 --> 53:21.650
I know I kid around a lot,
but I'm crazy about you.

53:23.450 --> 53:26.540
Marry me? Make me
the happiest man in the world.

53:29.290 --> 53:31.380
Yes. Yes!

53:35.630 --> 53:39.030
- Just hold tight.
- Where are you going?

53:39.070 --> 53:41.930
Oh my God. Mama.

53:41.970 --> 53:43.830
Okay, stop the band.

53:43.870 --> 53:45.700
Excuse me. I'd like
everyone here to know

53:45.740 --> 53:47.670
that this young lady
and I are getting married.

53:55.420 --> 53:58.280
She agreed with all her heart,
but couldn't understand

53:58.320 --> 54:01.480
why at the very moment
she said yes,

54:01.520 --> 54:04.550
Noah's face
came to her mind.

54:14.840 --> 54:17.460
Hey, Noah, yeah!

54:17.500 --> 54:20.200
Oh, good to see you.
Let me see you.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.970
You bleeding anywhere?
No?

54:22.010 --> 54:23.480
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

54:23.510 --> 54:25.070
Oh, I love you.

54:25.110 --> 54:27.980
Come on, there's something
I got to show you.

54:28.020 --> 54:29.450
- Come on.
- All right.

54:34.090 --> 54:35.780
What's going on?

54:35.820 --> 54:37.080
What is this?

54:37.120 --> 54:38.790
Here.

54:38.830 --> 54:40.320
I sold the house.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.790
- You sold the house?
- Yup.

54:43.830 --> 54:45.660
Gotta be out
by the end of the month.

54:45.700 --> 54:48.430
Between that and your GI Bill,
you ought to be able to get it now.

54:49.640 --> 54:51.570
- Get what?
- Your dream house.

54:51.610 --> 54:52.970
- The Windsor Plantation.
- Dad...

54:53.010 --> 54:55.130
Now, don't Dad me,
I don't want to hear about it.

54:55.180 --> 54:58.740
I already talked to the bank,
they're gonna give you the loan.

54:58.780 --> 55:02.610
- Well, I can't let you sell your house.
- It's done.

55:02.650 --> 55:06.140
It's a good thing.
You should do it.

55:11.760 --> 55:14.750
Wait a second. You sell the house,
where are you gonna live?

55:14.800 --> 55:16.350
With you, dummy,
what do you think?

55:16.400 --> 55:18.730
Somebody's got
to help you fix it up.

55:27.470 --> 55:29.570
Noah took a look
at the house,

55:29.610 --> 55:32.100
but only saw
one thing...

55:32.150 --> 55:34.440
Allie.

55:34.480 --> 55:37.810
He decided right there
to fulfill his life-long dream.

55:37.850 --> 55:42.450
He would rebuild the old house
from the ground up.

55:44.390 --> 55:49.450
And when Noah went to Charleston
to get the building plans approved,

55:49.500 --> 55:53.400
fate stepped in
and dealt him a sweet card.

56:00.370 --> 56:03.280
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus.

56:03.310 --> 56:05.540
Sorry, Mac, I can't stop the bus
until I get to the depot.

56:05.580 --> 56:07.710
No, no, no, please stop
the bus now. Please!

56:07.750 --> 56:09.310
Do you understand
English, pal?

56:09.350 --> 56:12.650
No one gets off till we get
to the depot. Now sit down.

56:12.690 --> 56:15.210
- God.
- Hey!

56:19.790 --> 56:21.320
Watch it, screwball!

56:21.360 --> 56:23.090
What are you doing?

56:23.130 --> 56:25.000
Hey!

56:25.030 --> 56:26.660
How old is your daughter now?

56:26.700 --> 56:28.960
- Well, you mind.
- He's right over there.

56:47.620 --> 56:49.420
Baby, hello.

56:59.100 --> 57:00.590
- Oh!
- Hold it.

57:06.170 --> 57:08.140
Oh, come with it.

57:14.210 --> 57:16.050
After seeing Allie that day,

57:16.080 --> 57:19.540
something inside
Noah snapped.

57:19.590 --> 57:21.180
He got the notion
into his head

57:21.220 --> 57:22.780
that if he restored
the old house

57:22.820 --> 57:25.160
where they had
come that night,

57:25.190 --> 57:28.790
Allie would find a way
to come back to him.

57:28.830 --> 57:31.060
Some called it
a labor of love.

57:31.100 --> 57:33.360
Others called it
something else.

57:33.400 --> 57:37.560
But in fact,
Noah had gone a little mad.

57:37.600 --> 57:39.270
- Excuse me.
- Would...

57:40.270 --> 57:41.930
It's time to eat.

57:41.980 --> 57:43.940
Lunch will be served
in the Sun Room today.

57:46.650 --> 57:50.480
The melon is good.
I had a bite.

57:50.520 --> 57:53.010
Did they ever
see each other again?

57:53.050 --> 57:55.320
Noah and Allie?

57:55.360 --> 57:57.820
Now you don't want
me to spoil the end of the story

57:57.860 --> 58:00.830
before I get
to the good part, do you?

58:00.860 --> 58:03.090
Where did I leave off?

58:03.130 --> 58:04.790
I shall not want.

58:04.830 --> 58:07.160
When Noah's father
died in November,

58:07.200 --> 58:08.930
the house
was all he had.

58:08.970 --> 58:11.200
He leadeth me down...

58:29.190 --> 58:32.180
In time, Noah
finished the house.

58:32.230 --> 58:34.220
Okay, smile.
Here we go.

58:36.400 --> 58:39.060
He took a good look
at what he had accomplished,

58:39.100 --> 58:42.070
got rip-roaring drunk
for 10 days,

58:42.100 --> 58:45.400
thought seriously
about setting it on fire,

58:45.440 --> 58:47.570
then finally
put the house up for sale.

58:47.610 --> 58:49.400
I'm prepared
to offer you this much.

58:51.410 --> 58:53.280
He had a number
of interested buyers,

58:53.310 --> 58:56.180
but he always found a reason
not to sell it to them.

58:56.220 --> 58:57.710
No.

58:57.750 --> 58:59.780
Either the bids
were too low,

58:59.820 --> 59:02.120
or if they met
his asking price,

59:02.160 --> 59:04.750
he felt it was worth
a lot more.

59:04.790 --> 59:07.560
It's a lot of money,
but I'll take it.

59:10.500 --> 59:12.330
$50,000.

59:12.370 --> 59:15.300
- That's more than my asking price.
- That's right.

59:15.340 --> 59:16.730
It's a great deal more.

59:21.510 --> 59:25.100
He told the man that offered him
$5,000 over his price

59:25.150 --> 59:28.110
that no one in his right mind
would do that

59:28.150 --> 59:30.910
and he wouldn't have
a lunatic living in his house.

59:33.150 --> 59:37.150
He worked out his frustration with life
on the creek every morning.

59:38.790 --> 59:42.490
And in the evenings,
to temper the sting of loneliness,

59:42.530 --> 59:45.050
there was Martha Shaw.

59:45.100 --> 59:46.860
Martha was a war widow

59:46.900 --> 59:49.560
who lived in Quail Ridge,
a town away.

59:53.810 --> 59:56.540
So you want to go out
tomorrow?

59:56.580 --> 59:58.270
I got to work.

59:58.310 --> 01:00:00.280
Well, we could
down to the river if you want to.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:02.080
Next week, sometime.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.780
Maybe we could
take a drive somewhere?

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:05.720
No.

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.910
Well,
I'm just asking you.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.860
What do you want, Noah?

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:26.500
What do you mean,
what do I want?

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.010
From me.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.740
Sometimes when you talk to me,
you don't even see me.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.350
Look, a woman knows
when a man looks into her eyes

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:48.260
and sees someone else.

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:57.760
Now you know I want to give you
all the things that you want,

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.040
right?

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:06.870
But I can't,

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:09.780
because they're gone...

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:14.580
they're broken.

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.520
All right?

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.340
Is the veil too much?

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.440
Are you kidding?
You look perfect!

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:49.390
You're the most
beautiful bride.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.520
- You look gorgeous, honey.
- Thank you.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.520
Wait until Lon sees you in this dress,
he's gonna go crazy.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.290
He won't be able
to take his eyes off you,

01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:01.530
or his hands.

01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:03.230
Oh, you're bad!

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:04.860
Have you seen
this morning's paper?

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.960
The "Daily Journal" says
that you are going to be

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:10.240
- the social highlight of the season.
- Of the season?

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.070
This is gonna be a celebration the likes
of which this town's never seen!

01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:16.280
She doesn't plan,
she plots, doesn't she?

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:21.450
- Mama, look, the Governor's coming.
- He better. Let me see.

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:26.820
Oh, boy.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.010
- All right Savannah, where are we at?
- We're 82 now.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.700
- Memphis, where are at?
- We're 89 now.

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:07.860
89, great,
up from 85.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.030
- Sir?
- Yes.

01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:10.500
You have a visitor.

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:14.430
Well, hello.
Baby, I didn't know you were coming.

01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:17.640
I'm... I'm so sorry,
I should have called.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.700
Baby, what are you talking about?
You don't have to call.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:22.910
- Guys, could you give us a minute?
- All right.

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:24.970
Yes, sir.
Miss Allie.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.180
Ma'am.

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.390
So what's up?

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.830
I don't paint anymore.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.100
I used to paint
all the time.

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.470
I really loved it.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.300
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:50.040
So paint.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.040
I will.

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:57.010
- I'm gonna start.
- Great.

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.750
Is everything okay?

01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:08.980
I need to get away.

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:11.360
Okay.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.460
I need to take care
of a few things.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.490
I need to clear
my head.

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.870
Okay,
should I be worried?

01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:22.270
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, that's reassuring.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.080
Listen, are you
all right?

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.780
- Yeah.
- Okay, then go.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.910
Take your time,
do whatever you need to do.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:34.150
It's okay to be nervous,
all right?

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:36.380
It's normal to get
cold feet before your wedding.

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.550
No, no second
thoughts, huh-uh.

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.330
I love you.

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:48.100
I'm going to be back from Seabrook
in a couple of days, okay?

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.900
- Seabrook?
- Yeah, Seabrook.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.240
Hello.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.860
I saw your picture
in the paper,

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:49.690
the one with you
and the house.

01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:52.600
And I just wanted to come
and see if you were okay.

01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:54.790
I mean, I wasn't
in the neighborhood or anything.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:55.820
I just...

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.040
So are you okay?

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.450
Okay, good.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:18.290
I'm a stupid woman,
I shouldn't have come.

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:41.640
You want to come in?

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.480
Okay.

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.280
This is a good story.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.410
I'm glad you like it.

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.520
I think
I've heard it before.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.650
Yes.

01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:00.690
Perhaps more than once?

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:02.200
Doctor needs
to see you.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.470
- Me? Now?
- No, him.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.970
But he hasn't finished
reading his story.

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:09.410
I'll read some more
when I'm through with the doctor.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.470
This shouldn't take
too long.

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:13.240
- All right.
- Don't you go away.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.180
I'll be right back.

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.340
While you waiting, maybe you'd like
to play the piano for a few minutes.

01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:20.370
You do like that.

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:22.580
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.020
- I don't know any tunes.
- You can read music.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:29.260
- No kidding?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:35.090
Who are you?

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:38.400
I'm Dr. Barnwell,
one of the new attending physicians.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.870
We haven't met,
so I thought I'd examine you myself.

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:45.810
Okay, so I see here

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:49.080
that you've had two heart attacks
over the last 18 months.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.410
Yeah, minor ones,
I think one was angina.

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:54.420
- Okay, any complications?
- Nope, feel fine.

01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:56.950
Okay, deep breath
for me.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:59.980
Okay, one more time.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.720
And deep breath.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.130
And one more.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:10.140
Terrific, terrific.
You still taking your medication?

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:13.070
- Every day, twice a day.
- Good, good, good, good, good.

01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:15.540
Okay, you can
put your shirt on.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.270
So I understand that you
read to Miss Hamilton.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.880
Yeah, to help
her remember.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.220
- Hmm.
- You don't think it'll help?

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:30.150
No, I don't.

01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:32.660
She remembers, Doc.

01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:35.960
I read to her
and she remembers.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.590
Not always,
but she remembers.

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:40.760
But senile dementia
is irreversible.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.530
It's degenerative.

01:08:42.570 --> 01:08:45.590
After a certain point,
its victims don't come back.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.500
Yeah, that's what
they keep telling me.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.570
Well, I just don't want
you to get your hopes up.

01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:53.440
Well, thanks, Doc,
but you know what they say?

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.070
Science goes only so far
and then comes God.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.810
Then comes God.

01:09:01.190 --> 01:09:04.280
Damn, I forgot to turn the page for her.
You through with me?

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.300
I guess they flipped
that page.

01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:29.680
No, that she's playing
by memory.

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.380
His name
is Lon Hammond, Jr.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.150
Hammond?
As in Hammond Cotton?

01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:38.710
As in Hammond Cotton.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.160
Well, your parents
must love him.

01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:45.930
He's a really good man, Noah.
You'd really like him.

01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:47.900
You love him?

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:53.160
Yeah, I do.
I love him very much.

01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:02.040
Well, that's that.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.610
You marry Lon
and we can be friends...

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.750
right?

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:10.550
Right.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.860
Are you hungry?

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.990
Do you want to stay
for dinner?

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:22.930
Umm...

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:34.110
I have to warn you,
I'm a cheap drunk.

01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:37.780
A couple more of these and you're gonna
be carrying me right out of here.

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.750
Well, you go slow then, I don't want
to have to take advantage of you.

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:43.280
You wouldn't dare.
I'm a married woman.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.050
Not yet.

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:53.160
What?

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.730
Why are you
looking at me like that?

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:02.840
Just memories.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.770
This room.

01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:14.910
This...
is this where we...

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.060
This is the room?

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.090
Huh...

01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:36.000
- I'm full.
- Me too.

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:41.910
"Oh how your fingers
drowse me.

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:44.420
Your breath falls
around me like dew.

01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:47.610
Your pulse lulls
the tympans of my ears.

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:50.140
I feel a merge
from head to foot.

01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:52.090
Delicious enough."

01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:55.790
It was real, wasn't it?

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.390
You and me.

01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:03.930
Such a long time ago,
we were just a couple of kids.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.770
But we really loved
each other, didn't we?

01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:20.250
I should go.

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:25.690
Goodbye.

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:29.720
Do you think
you could back tomorrow morning?

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.730
There's some place
I'd like to show you.

01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:36.120
Please.

01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:40.630
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:55.010
She had come back into his life

01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:57.050
like a sudden flame,

01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:59.610
blazing and streaming
into his heart.

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.030
Noah stayed up
all night

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.590
contemplating the certain agony
he knew would be his,

01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:08.190
if he were
to lose her twice.

01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:12.190
Oh, I do wish I could
figure out the end of this story.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.000
The children are here.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.530
Children?

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:18.670
- Not yours, his.
- Oh...

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:20.700
Do you mind?

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:22.810
Why, I'd love
to meet them.

01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:25.840
Come over here.

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:28.290
- Hi, Daddy.
- Sweetheart, how are you?

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.950
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Maggie.

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:32.750
Hi, I'm Allie.

01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:34.780
- Hi, I'm Mary Allen.
- Mary Allen.

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:37.300
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:38.890
- Hi.
- Hi, Maggie.

01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:41.460
Maggie, how are you?

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.560
Hello there, honey.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:43.660
Hi, Davanee.

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.190
- What a pretty name.
- Thank you.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:50.270
- Oh...
- Oh, how cute, thank you.

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:54.510
- And who's this?
- Edmond.

01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:56.070
Hi, Edmond.

01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:10.090
You know, I think
I'll run on up

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:13.120
and take my afternoon
nap, all right?

01:14:13.170 --> 01:14:16.400
- Come on, honey, let's go.
- There you go.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.230
- All right. Good.
- Thank you.

01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:20.260
I'll read some more later.

01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:22.900
All right, thank you.

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.000
I'm so happy
to meet you all.

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.480
- Goodbye.
- Bye, bye.

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:29.780
- Nice to meet you.
- Goodbye.

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.280
Bye.

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:35.340
- She seems good today.
- She is good.

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.650
I don't know, there's
something about today.

01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:41.990
Maybe it's a day
for a miracle.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.460
Daddy, come home.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.800
Mama doesn't know us.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.600
She doesn't recognize you.
She'll never understand.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.800
We miss you.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.670
This is crazy,
you living here.

01:14:56.710 --> 01:15:01.370
Yeah, you know we'll all help with Mom.
We can take shifts visiting.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:05.620
Look, guys,

01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:08.210
that's my sweetheart
in there.

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:11.020
I'm not leaving her.

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:13.920
This is my home now.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.620
Your mother is my home.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.530
- Hello?
- Hey, there.

01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:26.230
Hi, who is this?

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:28.040
It's Lon,
who were you expecting?

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:31.070
Uh, nobody, l...

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.740
I just... I'm just surprised.
How... how did you find me?

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.680
Well, there's only one
hotel in Seabrook.

01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:37.710
And when you didn't call,
I got worried.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:41.050
Where you been?
Are you all right?

01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:44.780
You know, I feel like an idiot, 'cause I
called your hotel about a hundred times.

01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:49.160
I'm fine.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.390
Anything you want
to tell me?

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:53.160
- No.
- No?

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.290
No.

01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.370
Okay.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.910
Lon, I love you.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.470
Call you tomorrow?

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:08.000
Okay.

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:39.300
Noah?

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:42.510
Noah!

01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:00.490
Hey, there.

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:08.640
Well, we better get going,
the rain's coming in.

01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:36.690
- You like it?
- It's spectacular.

01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:43.500
It's like a dream.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:47.540
- Do you want to feed them?
- Yeah.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.050
What are they all
doing here?

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.700
I don't know.

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:13.500
They're supposed to migrate
to the Guatemala sound.

01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.200
They won't stay here?

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.140
No...

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:21.350
they'll go back
where they came from.

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:33.820
You're different.

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:36.350
What do you mean?

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.020
Just the way you look.
Everything.

01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:44.040
You look different too,
but in a good way.

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:51.800
You know, you're kinda
the same though.

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:55.650
Yeah?

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.810
Yeah.

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:02.220
And you really did it.

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:04.690
- What?
- Everything.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.450
The house...

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:10.220
it's beautiful
what you did.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.260
Well, I promised you
I would.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.840
Great.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.910
We got to go.

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:02.440
Noah!

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.160
Why didn't you
write me?

01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:58.530
Why?

01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:02.030
It wasn't over for me.

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:04.740
I waited for you
for seven years.

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:06.370
And now it's too late.

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:10.340
I wrote you 365 letters.

01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:14.250
I wrote you every day
for a year.

01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:16.690
- You wrote me?
- Yes.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.620
You...

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.960
It wasn't over.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.090
It still isn't over.

01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:29.620
Oh...

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.420
You got
to be kidding me.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.560
All this time,
that's what I'd been missing?

01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:46.230
Let's do it again.

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:01.550
Noah.

01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:23.270
Noah.

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.150
Wake up.

01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:37.680
- Wake up.
- Um-mmm.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.620
- Um-mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:42.490
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm...

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.430
- Hi.
- You're trying to kill me, woman.

01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:49.960
- Huh-uh.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.300
- Mmm...
- Mmm...

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.670
I need rest.

01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:59.970
I need food
so I can regain my strength.

01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:03.840
Okay, what do you want?

01:25:06.450 --> 01:25:09.420
Umm... umm...

01:25:09.450 --> 01:25:11.420
some pancakes.

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.620
Okay.

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:15.750
And bacon.

01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:18.730
- Okay.
- And some chicken.

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:07.110
She's the one,
isn't she?

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:15.210
Can I meet her?

01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:18.680
I'd really like to meet her.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.550
I don't know if that's
a good idea, Martha.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.430
So this is Martha?

01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:29.430
Hi, I'm Allie.

01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:31.460
I've heard
a lot about you.

01:26:32.670 --> 01:26:34.610
I've heard
a lot about you, too.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.470
You want to come in?

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:40.210
Are you sure?

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:43.440
Yeah, yeah,
Noah's just saying how hungry he was.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.920
And, you know,
you could put on a pot of tea.

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.450
Come on in.

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:54.460
Come on in.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.370
It was nice meeting you,
Martha.

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.670
- Nice meeting you too.
- Goodbye.

01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:09.260
Take care.

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:31.890
She's sensational.
She really is.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.030
I'm really glad
that I came, Noah.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.530
I'd forgotten
what it's like.

01:27:46.650 --> 01:27:49.710
For the first time
since I lost Richard,

01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:52.220
I feel like I've got something
to look forward to.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.860
Mmm...

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.620
Lon is on his way here.

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:18.050
I'm afraid your father spilled
the beans about Noah,

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:20.000
and when Lon didn't hear
from you again last night,

01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:21.120
he decided to come.

01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:24.330
Well, that's great.
That's just terrific.

01:30:24.370 --> 01:30:27.860
You, me, Noah and Lon,
one big happy family.

01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:36.340
Tell me about
the letters, Mother.

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:38.650
- Is it true?
- Yes.

01:30:39.650 --> 01:30:42.420
You watched me
cry myself to sleep

01:30:42.450 --> 01:30:44.850
for months and months

01:30:44.890 --> 01:30:47.360
and you never
said anything.

01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:49.050
- How could you do that?
- I'm sorry.

01:30:49.090 --> 01:30:51.490
- You're sorry? You're sorry?
- Yes, I am... I am sorry.

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:53.190
Because of you,
my entire life is ruined!

01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:54.860
Okay, yes,
I stole your letters.

01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:56.530
It was wrong,
but stop being dramatic

01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:58.540
and at least take some
of the responsibility.

01:31:00.670 --> 01:31:03.610
You came down here.
You knew what you were doing.

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.010
You knew this would happen.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.170
Oh, so now I'm a tramp?

01:31:07.210 --> 01:31:08.940
You are unbelievable.

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:11.070
Unbelievable.

01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:17.350
Go on and get
some clothes on.

01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:19.480
Let's take a drive.

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.220
Let's take a drive? Why would I want
to go anywhere with you?

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:25.890
Because I might know you
a little better than you think.

01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:28.420
And I don't want
you waking up one morning

01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:30.090
thinking that
if you'd known everything,

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:31.690
you might have
done something different.

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.210
What are we
doing here, Mama?

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.490
Do you see
that man, there?

01:31:56.630 --> 01:31:58.060
Mm-hmm.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.330
Don't look like it now,
but 25 years ago...

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:07.930
oh my goodness,
he was really something.

01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:10.600
We were out of our minds
in love, let me tell you.

01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:16.440
Wow.

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.210
Well, naturally,
your grandfather was furious, so...

01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:22.450
we decided
to run away.

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:28.960
We didn't even make the next town
before the police picked us up.

01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.620
But that was then.

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:39.030
You know sometimes
when I'm in the area,

01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:41.660
I just stop here
and I watch him,

01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:48.280
trying to picture how different my life
might have been.

01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:05.560
I want you to know
that I love your father.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.620
- Mama, I'm...
- No, goddamn it, this is important

01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:09.960
and you need
to hear it. I do.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.490
He is a wonderful man.

01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:15.700
He is good to me
and I don't deserve him.

01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:18.540
I love him, Allie,
I do, I love him.

01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:23.250
I know.

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.390
Oh, God.

01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:34.920
Oh, this is just
very embarrassing.

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.290
Oh, I'm a stupid woman.

01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:41.030
Look at me,
the big old bawl-bag.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.700
It's crazy.

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:56.810
I don't even know
who that person is.

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:06.950
Oh, boy.

01:34:35.090 --> 01:34:36.490
Okay.

01:34:46.330 --> 01:34:47.800
Allie!

01:35:04.650 --> 01:35:06.340
Here.

01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:14.250
I hope you make
the right choice.

01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.820
Interesting morning?

01:35:42.850 --> 01:35:43.840
Yeah.

01:35:46.290 --> 01:35:47.950
Lon's here in town.

01:35:51.130 --> 01:35:52.890
He's here?

01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:57.100
Yeah, we saw
his car on the way,

01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:58.730
at the hotel.

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:06.200
Huh.

01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:10.810
I see you
got my letters.

01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:16.220
Finally.

01:36:23.130 --> 01:36:24.750
What are you
going to do, Al?

01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:31.160
I don't know.

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.300
We're back to that?

01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:43.510
Are we back there?

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:48.220
What about the past couple of days?
They happened, you know?

01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:50.450
I know that they happened,
and they were wonderful,

01:36:50.490 --> 01:36:53.690
but they were also
very irresponsible.

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.690
I have a fiance
waiting for me at a hotel,

01:36:55.730 --> 01:36:56.950
who's going
to be crushed

01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:58.480
- when he finds out.
- So you make love to me

01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:00.790
and then you go back
to your husband?

01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:02.660
Was that your plan?

01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:04.530
Was that a test
that I didn't pass?!

01:37:04.570 --> 01:37:07.200
No, I made a promise to a man, he gave
me a ring and I gave him my word.

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:08.470
And your word is
shot to hell now,

01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:10.030
- don't you think?
- I don't... I don't know.

01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:11.600
I'll find out
when I talk to him.

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.630
This is not about
keeping your promise,

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.240
and it's not about
following your heart,

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.010
it's about security.

01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:20.180
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Money!

01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:22.190
- What are you ta...
- He's got a lot of money.

01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:24.280
- Now I hate you, you smug bastard.
- Well, I hate you.

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.190
- If you leave here, I hate you.
- You wou...

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:27.750
- Hate you if you leave here.
- Have you been paying attention

01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:28.880
to anything that's happening?

01:37:28.930 --> 01:37:30.890
I guess not.
I think I must have misread

01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:32.660
- all of those signals.
- I guess you did.

01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:38.060
You're bored.
You're bored and you know it.

01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.570
You wouldn't be here
if there wasn't something missing.

01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:43.340
You arrogant
son of a bitch!

01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:46.310
Would you just
stay with me?

01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:48.180
Stay with you?
What for?

01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:51.200
- Look at us, we're already fighting.
- Well, that's what we do.

01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:52.650
We fight.

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.880
You tell me when I'm being
an arrogant son of a bitch

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:57.220
and I tell you when you're
being a pain in the ass.

01:37:57.260 --> 01:38:00.450
Which you are
99% of the time.

01:38:00.490 --> 01:38:02.820
I'm not afraid
to hurt your feelings.

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:04.760
They have like
a two second rebound rate

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.590
and you're back doing the next
pain-in-the-ass thing.

01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:08.620
So, what?

01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:11.230
So it's not gonna be easy.
It's gonna be really hard.

01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:13.570
And we're gonna have to work
at this every day,

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.570
but I want to do that,
because I want you.

01:38:15.610 --> 01:38:20.600
I want all of you,
forever, you and me, every day.

01:38:20.650 --> 01:38:23.050
Will you do
something for me?

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.110
Please?
Will you just picture your life for me?

01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:31.110
30 years from now,
40 years from now, what's it look like?

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.850
If it's with
that guy, go! Go!

01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:36.620
I lost you once,
I think I could do it again,

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.600
if I thought it's
what you really wanted.

01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:41.220
But don't you take
the easy way out.

01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:43.460
What easy way?
There is no easy way,

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.830
no matter what I do,
somebody gets hurt.

01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:48.100
Would you stop thinking
about what everyone wants.

01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:50.800
Stop thinking
about what I want, what he wants,

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.870
what your parents want.
What do you want?

01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:57.580
- What do you want?
- It's not that simple.

01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:00.880
- What do you want?
- It's not...

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:04.090
Goddamn it,
what do you want?

01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:08.790
I have to go.

01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:20.160
My dearest Allie,

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:23.530
I couldn't sleep last night because
I know that it's over between us.

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.800
I'm not bitter anymore, because I know
that what we had was real.

01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:32.370
And if in some distant
place in the future

01:40:32.410 --> 01:40:35.040
we see each other
in our new lives,

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:36.710
I'll smile
at you with joy

01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:40.880
and remember how
we spent a summer beneath the trees

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:44.790
learning from each other
and growing in love.

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.740
The best love
is the kind that awakens the soul

01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:07.270
and makes us
reach for more,

01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:09.610
that plants a fire
in our hearts

01:41:09.650 --> 01:41:12.450
and brings peace
to our minds.

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:15.280
And that's what you've
given me.

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.190
That's what I'd hoped
to give to you forever.

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:22.280
I love you.
I'll be seeing you, Noah.

01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:27.330
It's beautiful.
It's a beautiful story.

01:41:27.370 --> 01:41:28.660
Yes, it is.

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:32.030
I don't know why,
but it makes me feel sad.

01:41:35.010 --> 01:41:37.000
I know you feel
lost right now,

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.870
but don't worry,

01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:41.400
nothing is ever lost,
nor can be lost.

01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:45.250
The body sluggish,
aged, cold,

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:47.480
the embers left

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.210
from earlier fires.

01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:51.120
shall duly flame again.

01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:54.480
Did you write that?

01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:57.890
No, that was Walt Whitman.

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:01.520
I think I knew him.

01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:03.930
I think you did.

01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:08.960
Shall we go in?
I'm feeling a little chilly.

01:42:09.010 --> 01:42:11.030
Okay.

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.870
Thank you.

01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:24.380
Well, who did
all of this?

01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:28.420
I did, with a little help
from my friends on the nursing staff.

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:30.650
Oh...

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.200
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:48.970
Neither have I.

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:53.140
Shall we?

01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:03.690
- Some grape juice?
- I'd love it.

01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:09.420
Ah, so many pills.
How sick are you?

01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:13.340
The sickness has become
a relative term for me.

01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:18.000
I think of it now as more a general
wearing out process.

01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:20.800
To you.

01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:31.820
So what happened?

01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:33.620
In the story,

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:35.820
which one did she choose?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.360
Okay,

01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:46.130
the way I see it,
I got three choices.

01:43:46.170 --> 01:43:47.760
One, I can shoot him.

01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:51.800
Two, I can kick
the crap out of him.

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:55.140
Or three...
I leave you.

01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:03.820
Well, all that's no good.

01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:07.390
You see, 'cause...

01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:11.580
none of those options
get me you.

01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:17.090
And in spite of everything,

01:44:17.130 --> 01:44:18.600
I love you.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.770
I love you too.

01:44:24.710 --> 01:44:26.840
I meant what I said
when I gave you that ring.

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:28.210
I did too.

01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:30.870
I did too.
It's just that when I'm...

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.080
when I'm with Noah
I feel like one person

01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:36.420
and when I'm with you
I feel like someone totally different.

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:42.460
Look, it's normal
not to forget your first love.

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.790
I love you, Allie,

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:55.930
but I want you
for myself.

01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:57.700
I don't want to have
to convince my fiance

01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:00.230
that she should be
with me.

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:03.440
You don't have to.

01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:06.880
I already know
I should be with you.

01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:11.250
And they lived happily
ever after.

01:45:11.290 --> 01:45:14.880
Who? Who did?

01:45:23.130 --> 01:45:26.000
Oh yes,

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.970
of course.

01:46:09.850 --> 01:46:11.710
I remember now.

01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:14.990
It was us.

01:46:16.150 --> 01:46:18.490
- It was us. It was us.
- Oh, my darling.

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.890
Oh my sweetheart.

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:23.890
I love you so much.

01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:27.400
Oh, my baby.

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.430
Noah, Noah.

01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:33.960
I love you, Angel.

01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.870
- What happened to me?
- Nothing.

01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:41.540
You just went away
for a little while.

01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:49.780
- How much time do we have?
- I'm not sure.

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:52.150
Last time it was no more
than five minutes.

01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:57.020
Okay.

01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:01.230
Hey, I brought along
an old friend.

01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:22.480
# I'll be seeing you #

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:27.620
# In all the old
familiar places #

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:33.060
# That this heart
of mine embraces #

01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:35.960
# All day through #

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.130
# In that small cafe... #

01:47:42.170 --> 01:47:45.470
- How are the children?
- Oh, they're fine.

01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:47.480
Now,
they were here today...

01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:50.280
Little Noah, Davanee too.

01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:51.910
They're getting so big.

01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:56.350
- #... carousel, the chestnut trees #
- Oh, boy.

01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:58.410
- # The wishing well... #
- How fast the time goes.

01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:59.950
Mm-hmm.

01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:01.980
It flies right on by.

01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:03.960
Oh yes, it does.

01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:09.430
# In every lovely
summer's day... #

01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:11.660
Will you tell them
I love them?

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:15.000
- # That's light and gay #
- Of course I will.

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.800
- # I'll always #
- And that I'm sorry.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.400
# Think of you that way #

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.430
- I'll tell them, sweetheart.
- # I'll find you #

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:25.280
# In the morning sun #

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.010
# And when
the night is new #

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:34.420
# I'll be looking at the moon #
# But I'll be seeing you... #

01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:37.450
Remember that story you were
reading to me?

01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:39.390
Why, yes.

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:48.740
Do you think that
I could be her tonight?

01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:52.100
Would that be
all right?

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:54.910
You know what
we could do?

01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:58.540
Maybe we could get a car
and we could go for a ride.

01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:02.140
Why could get out of here
and just go someplace, you want to?

01:49:02.190 --> 01:49:05.310
I don't think so.
Not tonight, darling.

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.090
Come on, why not?

01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:10.120
Wait a minute...

01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:15.560
why did you call me darling?
I don't know you.

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.590
What's going on here?
Am I supposed to know you?

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:21.430
- Allie... Allie, sweetheart.
- No, no, no!

01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:24.030
Hey, Allie, I love you,
stay with me, don't leave...

01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:26.340
No!

01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:29.500
- Who are you?
- I'm Noah, I'm Noah and you're Allie.

01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:32.110
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

01:49:32.150 --> 01:49:34.380
- Come on, baby.
- Don't come near me!

01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:36.280
- Don't you come near me!
- Allie... Allie, l...

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.020
Help! Help!

01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:40.050
- Help me!
- Calm down, Allie, calm down.

01:49:40.090 --> 01:49:41.080
No, no, not you!

01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:42.750
Calm down, Allie! It's all right, sugar,
come on.

01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:44.690
- No! Let me go!
- It's all right, baby. Just calm down!

01:49:44.730 --> 01:49:48.100
- No! Leave me alone.
- Calm down, Allie, it's all right.

01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.100
- Somebody help me!
- Now calm down.

01:49:50.130 --> 01:49:51.230
- Help!
- Doctor!

01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:53.200
Talk to me.

01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:55.600
- Somebody help me!
- Calm down!

01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:58.570
- Give her two cc's.
- No! No!

01:49:58.610 --> 01:49:59.740
Calm down, Allie.

01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:01.400
- Calm down, Allie, yes.
- One, two...

01:50:01.450 --> 01:50:03.140
...three.

01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:06.080
- Allie, it's all right. It's all right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:07.670
Okay, now take a look.

01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:10.480
Let's take a look.
One... oh, she's fine.

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:12.750
- Good. Just breathe.
- She's fine. She's fine.

01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:15.590
Stay calm, just breathe
in and out, come on.

01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:17.860
- Relax...
- You're going to be okay, Allie.

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:19.260
- Relax.
- Allie?

01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:21.890
You're fine, honey.

01:50:21.930 --> 01:50:23.130
Shh...

01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:27.540
# I'll be seeing you #

01:50:27.570 --> 01:50:32.940
# In every lovely
summer's day #

01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:38.680
# In everything
that's light and gay #

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:43.080
# I'll always think
of you that way #

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:48.520
# I'll find you
in the morning sun #

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:51.930
# And when
the night is new... #

01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:58.930
# I'll be looking
at the moon #

01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:07.610
# But I'll be seeing you #

01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.770
# I'll be seeing you #

01:51:09.810 --> 01:51:13.510
# I'll be seeing you. #

01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:22.480
Morning, Mr. Calhoun.

01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:24.850
Mr. Calhoun?

01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:29.590
Call Dr. Von Pettit
and USC, okay?

01:51:29.630 --> 01:51:32.000
I've got no BP, I got no pulse.
I've got nothing.

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:34.330
Let them know we are in full arrest.
Call me on my cell.

01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:36.770
Okay, will do.

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:56.020
We talked about this.

01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:58.720
It's all right now.
Come on, come on, precious.

01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:01.460
Okay, yes,
come on, let's go.

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.260
It's okay, baby,
come on.

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:05.730
You know Mr. Holmes.

01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:11.300
Just try it.

01:52:56.850 --> 01:52:58.550
Oh, Mr. Calhoun.

01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:01.580
Welcome back.

01:53:01.630 --> 01:53:05.360
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Fit as a fiddle.

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:08.830
- Where you going?
- I was just taking a walk.

01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:11.230
I can't sleep.

01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:13.960
Well, you know you're not supposed to,
it's against the rules.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.440
Yeah, I know.

01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:19.670
You weren't really
going for a walk, were you?

01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:21.900
You were going
to see Miss Allie.

01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:25.510
I just got out
of the hospital

01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:27.380
and I miss her.

01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:29.410
Mr. Calhoun,

01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:32.080
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you see her tonight.

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:35.650
Now you're gonna have
to go back to your room.

01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:38.860
As for me,

01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:40.890
I'm gonna
go downstairs

01:53:40.930 --> 01:53:43.530
and get myself
a cup of coffee.

01:53:43.570 --> 01:53:46.400
I won't be back
to check on you for a while,

01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:48.500
so don't
do anything foolish.

01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:46.250
Hi.

01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:56.530
Noah.

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:00.070
Noah.

01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:05.640
Hi, sweetheart.

01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:08.910
I'm sorry I haven't
been able to be here to read to you.

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:12.810
I didn't know
what to do.

01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:15.480
I was afraid
you were never coming back.

01:55:15.530 --> 01:55:17.490
I'll always come back.

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:25.390
What's gonna happen

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:28.530
when I can't
remember anything any more?

01:55:30.510 --> 01:55:31.700
What will you do?

01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:34.800
I'll be here.

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.070
I'll never leave you.

01:55:46.290 --> 01:55:48.760
I need to ask
you something.

01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:50.590
What is it,
sweetheart?

01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:58.230
Do you think

01:55:58.270 --> 01:56:00.260
that our love

01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:02.400
can create miracles?

01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:05.810
Yes, I do.

01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:10.480
That's what brings
you back to me each time.

01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:21.950
Do you think our love

01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:24.220
could take us
away together?

01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:34.630
I think our love
can do anything we want it to.

01:56:47.650 --> 01:56:50.640
I love you.

01:56:50.690 --> 01:56:52.710
I love you, Allie.

01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:11.970
Good night.

01:57:12.010 --> 01:57:14.000
Good night.

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:21.380
I'll be seeing you.

01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:25.250
# La la la la #

01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:27.020
# Da da da da #

01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:29.180
# Dum ba da #
